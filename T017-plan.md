# T017 Plan: Performance Testing and Optimization

## Overview
This task focuses on performance testing and optimization of the Trump Goggles tooltip functionality. The goal is to ensure the feature performs efficiently even on large pages with many conversions, maintaining responsiveness and minimal impact on page performance.

## Approach

### 1. Setup Performance Testing Environment
- Create a performance test page with controllable numbers of convertible text nodes
- Set up metrics collection for key performance indicators:
  - DOM modification time
  - Event handling latency
  - Memory usage
  - Rendering performance (frames per second)
- Use the browser's Performance API and DevTools for measurements

### 2. Benchmark DOM Modification
- Test DOM modification performance with:
  - Small number of conversions (10-50)
  - Medium number of conversions (100-500)
  - Large number of conversions (1000+)
- Measure and record:
  - Initial page processing time
  - DOM mutation processing time
  - Memory consumption before and after conversions

### 3. Test Event Delegation Performance
- Benchmark mouseover/mouseout and focus/blur event handling:
  - Measure time between event trigger and tooltip appearance
  - Test with various densities of convertible elements
  - Identify any event handling bottlenecks
- Test keyboard navigation performance

### 4. Profile Tooltip Functionality
- Profile show/hide operations for performance issues
- Analyze positioning calculations for potential optimizations
- Identify any layout thrashing or excessive reflows
- Monitor memory usage for potential leaks

### 5. Implement Optimizations
Based on testing results, implement optimizations that may include:
- Throttle/debounce mouseover/mouseout events to prevent excessive calculations
- Optimize positioning logic to reduce DOM queries
- Cache element dimensions where appropriate
- Use CSS transforms instead of position changes where possible
- Implement virtualization for large numbers of converted elements
- Batch DOM operations to minimize reflows

### 6. Verification Testing
- Re-run all performance tests with optimizations applied
- Compare before/after metrics
- Ensure no regressions in functionality or accessibility
- Document improvements achieved

## Implementation Steps

1. Create performance test page with configurable number of conversions
2. Set up performance measurement infrastructure
3. Run baseline performance tests and record results
4. Analyze results to identify bottlenecks
5. Implement optimizations based on findings
6. Verify optimizations with follow-up testing
7. Document performance considerations and optimizations

## Acceptance Criteria
- Feature performs acceptably on pages with high numbers of conversions (1000+)
- No noticeable slowdown during normal user interaction
- Event delegation remains responsive (< 100ms latency)
- Memory usage remains stable over time
- All optimizations maintain full functionality and accessibility
