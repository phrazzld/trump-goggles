# TEST-03: Create Automated Test Suite

## Task Description
Develop an automated testing framework for the Trump Goggles browser extension to ensure reliability and prevent regressions. The framework should test core functionality, text patterns, DOM processing, and provide visual verification guidelines.

## Current Testing Situation
- Manual test files exist in test/manual/
- Some basic unit tests exist in test/ directory
- Vitest is configured in vitest.config.js
- Testing infrastructure appears to be partially implemented but not comprehensive

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Testing Framework Setup
- Utilize Vitest as the testing framework (already configured in project)
- Set up JSDOM for simulating browser environment
- Configure test helpers for common operations
- Create mocks for browser extension APIs (chrome, browser)

### 2. Test Types to Implement

#### Unit Tests
- Test individual modules in isolation
- Mock dependencies to focus on specific behavior
- Cover core utility functions and business logic

#### Integration Tests
- Test interactions between modules
- Verify DOM processing pipeline
- Test observer patterns and event handling

#### End-to-End-like Tests
- Simulate browser environment with JSDOM
- Test full extension functionality in mock environment
- Test content script injection and processing

### 3. Areas to Test

#### Core Functionality
- Trump mappings generation
- Text replacement logic
- Browser detection
- Browser API adapters
- Error handling

#### DOM Processing
- Text node processing
- Ignoring inappropriate elements (forms, inputs)
- MutationObserver handling

#### Edge Cases
- Large documents
- Dynamic content
- Various text patterns
- Error conditions

### 4. Test Fixtures
- Create HTML fixtures for various scenarios
- Create text fixtures with different Trump patterns
- Create fixture data for extension states

### 5. Implementation Plan
1. Set up test helpers and utilities
2. Create mocks for browser APIs
3. Implement unit tests for core modules
4. Implement integration tests for key workflows
5. Create visual verification checklist
6. Ensure all tests pass consistently

### 6. Success Criteria
- Comprehensive test coverage for core functionality
- Tests that verify cross-browser compatibility
- Reliable, repeatable test execution
- Clear documentation of test approach and coverage
