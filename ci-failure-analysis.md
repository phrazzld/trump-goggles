# CI Failure Analysis - Round 1

## Issue Overview
The CI workflow for PR #2 has failed with the following error:

```
Invalid format '/home/runner/setup-pnpm/node_modules/.bin/store/v3'
```

This error occurs during the "Get pnpm store directory" step of the GitHub Actions workflow.

## Root Cause Analysis
The error suggests an issue with how we're trying to get the pnpm store path in our workflow. The command `pnpm store path` is returning a path that GitHub Actions can't properly process when trying to set it as an output variable.

Looking at the error more closely, the issue is in this line of our workflow:
```yaml
echo "STORE_PATH=$(pnpm store path)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

The problem appears to be that the output format from `pnpm store path` is causing an issue when being set as a GitHub Actions output variable.

## Fix Recommendations

1. Update the GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/ci.yml) to fix the pnpm store path issue:

```yaml
- name: Get pnpm store directory
  id: pnpm-cache
  shell: bash
  run: |
    echo "STORE_PATH=$(pnpm config get store-dir)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

Using `pnpm config get store-dir` instead of `pnpm store path` should provide a more reliable way to get the store directory.

2. Alternative approach - hardcode a known location:

```yaml
- name: Get pnpm store directory
  id: pnpm-cache
  shell: bash
  run: |
    echo "STORE_PATH=~/.pnpm-store" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

This would use a predictable location for the pnpm store directory.

## Implementation Plan
1. Update the ci.yml file with the fixed command
2. Commit and push the changes
3. Re-run the GitHub Actions workflow
4. Verify that the CI passes successfully

The fix is straightforward and should resolve the issue with the pnpm store path.
