## Original Ticket Text
- [~] T052: Fix TypeScript errors in bundled scripts
  - Fix variable redeclaration errors (Logger, TrumpMappings)
  - Address implicit any types in utility scripts
  - Ensure proper type checking for all bundled scripts

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

This task involves fixing TypeScript errors in bundled scripts, with specific focus on:

1. Variable redeclaration errors (specifically identified for Logger and TrumpMappings)
2. Addressing implicit any types in utility scripts
3. Ensuring proper type checking for all bundled scripts

I need to analyze the current state of the codebase, identify the TypeScript errors mentioned, and implement fixes while adhering to the project's development philosophy. Critical considerations include ensuring proper type declarations, avoiding any types, and maintaining backward compatibility and functionality.

The development philosophy emphasizes:
- Strict type checking
- No use of `any` type
- Explicit typing for functions and variables
- Clean code with meaningful naming
- Proper error handling
- Avoiding type suppressions
- Using modern TypeScript features and patterns

Some key questions to consider:
1. How are Logger and TrumpMappings currently implemented and what's causing the redeclaration errors?
2. Where are implicit any types appearing in utility scripts?
3. What's currently preventing proper type checking in bundled scripts?
4. How can we ensure the fixes don't introduce regressions?
5. What are the best TypeScript practices to apply for these specific issues?

Let me analyze the code to answer these questions and develop a comprehensive plan for addressing the TypeScript errors.
