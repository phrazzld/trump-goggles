# Todo List

## Technical Debt

- [x] T050: Fix TypeScript errors in test files
  - Find a proper solution to address type errors in test files
  - Update test files to properly type mock objects
  - Create proper type definitions for mock objects
  - Configure TypeScript properly for test files

- [ ] T051: Fix remaining TypeScript errors in test files (in progress)
  - Address the most common TypeScript errors identified by our type checking script
  - Update mock objects to properly implement their interfaces
  - Fix type mismatches between JSDOM's window object and the real Window interface
  - Ensure all test files pass TypeScript checks with the test-specific configuration
  
- [ ] T052: Fix TypeScript errors in bundled scripts
  - Fix variable redeclaration errors (Logger, TrumpMappings)
  - Address implicit any types in utility scripts
  - Ensure proper type checking for all bundled scripts
  
Note: A significant portion of the TypeScript errors have been fixed, especially the most critical ones related to DOMWindow vs Window type issues, NodeList conversion issues, and boolean index errors. Some non-critical TypeScript errors are still present but will be addressed incrementally in T051 and T052.
