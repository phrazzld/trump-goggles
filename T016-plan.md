# T016 Plan: Verify and enhance accessibility support

## Overview
This task focuses on ensuring the tooltip functionality complies with web accessibility standards, making it usable by people with disabilities using assistive technologies like screen readers and keyboard navigation. 

## Approach

### 1. Keyboard Navigation Verification
- Confirm that wrapper spans with `tabindex="0"` allow keyboard focus
- Verify natural tab order flow through the page's converted elements
- Test arrow key navigation if implemented
- Test keyboard dismissal with Escape key

### 2. ARIA Attributes Verification
- Verify the tooltip element has `role="tooltip"` 
- Confirm `aria-describedby` correctly links converted text to tooltip
- Verify `aria-hidden` state changes correctly when showing/hiding tooltip

### 3. Screen Reader Testing
- Test with screen readers:
  - VoiceOver (macOS) - Primary focus due to developer environment
  - NVDA (Windows) - If accessible
  - JAWS (Windows) - If accessible
- Verify that:
  - Screen readers announce the presence of tooltips
  - Original text is properly announced when converted text receives focus
  - Proper context is maintained for screen reader users

### 4. Visual Accessibility
- Check tooltip text color contrast (must meet WCAG AA - 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Verify that the tooltip is visible against various background colors
- Check that tooltip size and positioning remain accessible on different screen sizes

### 5. Enhanced Accessibility Features
- Add any missing ARIA roles or attributes identified during testing
- Optimize focus styles for better visibility
- Ensure tooltip behavior consistently follows accessibility best practices

## Implementation Steps

1. Create test page with various converted text examples
2. Perform keyboard navigation testing
3. Run accessibility checker tools (axe, Lighthouse)
4. Test with screen readers
5. Measure color contrast
6. Implement necessary improvements
7. Document accessibility features in README.md and docs/behavior.md

## Acceptance Criteria
- Keyboard users can navigate to converted text elements
- Screen readers announce original text appropriately when focused
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
- All ARIA attributes are correctly implemented
- Basic accessibility checker tools report no critical issues
