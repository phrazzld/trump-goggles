## Title

Enable strict TypeScript checking for test files

## Original Ticket Text

- Enable strict mode in tsconfig.test.json
- Fix type assertion issues in tooltip-manager-simplified.test.ts
- Fix missing type exports (DOMWindow vs JSDOMWindow)
- Address unused variable warnings
- Fix null/undefined checking issues
- Ensure all test files pass strict TypeScript checking

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

**Context:** This task involves enabling strict TypeScript checking across the entire test suite. The test files were recently converted from JavaScript to TypeScript as part of T054, but with relaxed TypeScript settings to avoid immediate breakage. Now we need to enable strict mode and fix all resulting type violations.

**Key Considerations:**

1. **Scope**: All test files in the `test/` directory must pass strict TypeScript checking
2. **Risk**: High risk of breaking many tests due to strict mode violations
3. **Types**: Need to resolve type system issues including:
   - Type assertion problems in mocked components
   - Missing or incorrect type exports (DOMWindow/JSDOMWindow)
   - Unused variable warnings that become errors in strict mode
   - Null/undefined checking violations
4. **Testing**: All 257 tests must continue to pass after changes
5. **Philosophy Alignment**: Must follow DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md principles, especially around type safety and explicit typing

**Analysis Questions:**

- What are the specific strict mode violations currently present?
- How should type assertions in test mocks be properly handled?
- What's the correct approach to DOMWindow vs JSDOMWindow type exports?
- Which unused variables can be safely removed vs need to be marked as intentionally unused?
- How to handle null/undefined checking in test contexts where mocks might return undefined?
- What's the systematic approach to enable strict mode without breaking existing functionality?

**Success Criteria:**

- `tsconfig.test.json` has strict mode enabled
- All TypeScript strict mode violations resolved
- All 257 tests continue to pass
- No TypeScript errors when running `npx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.test.json`
- Code follows TypeScript best practices from DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY_APPENDIX_TYPESCRIPT.md
