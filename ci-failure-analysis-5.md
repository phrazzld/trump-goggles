# CI Failure Analysis - Round 5

## Issue Overview
We're getting a syntax error in our ESLint configuration:

```
Configuration for rule "semi" is invalid. Expected severity of "off", 0, "warn", 1, "error", or 2.
You passed '"always"'.
```

## Root Cause Analysis
In the `eslint.config.js` file, we have an invalid rule configuration for the `semi` rule. The rule is configured as `'semi': ['always']` which is incorrect. ESLint rules require a severity level as the first element in the array.

## Fix Recommendations

Update the `semi` rule in `eslint.config.js`:

```javascript
// Incorrect:
'semi': ['always'],

// Correct:
'semi': ['error', 'always'],
```

The first element in the array should be the severity level ('error', 'warn', or 'off'), and the second element is the rule configuration.

## Implementation Plan
1. Fix the `semi` rule in `eslint.config.js`
2. Commit and push the changes
3. Re-run the GitHub Actions workflow
4. Verify that the CI passes successfully

This is a simple syntax error that should be easy to fix by correctly formatting the rule configuration.
