# TEST-08: Execute Full Verification Suite

## Task Summary
This task requires running the complete project verification suite, including TypeScript checking, linting, format checking, testing, and coverage analysis. Any issues that arise during verification must be fixed.

## Current State
- The project has completed all previous tickets in the remediation plan
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled and all related errors have been fixed
- Pre-commit hooks and CI have been updated to include type checking
- Test files for nickname mappings have been implemented
- CI has been updated for test coverage reporting

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Run All Verification Steps
We'll run each verification command sequentially to identify any issues:

1. TypeScript checking: `pnpm typecheck`
2. Linting: `pnpm lint`
3. Format checking: `pnpm format:check`
4. Testing: `pnpm test`
5. Coverage analysis: `pnpm test:coverage`

### 2. Analyze and Fix Any Issues
If any verification step fails, we'll:
1. Identify the root cause of the issue
2. Implement a fix that aligns with the project's development philosophy
3. Verify the fix resolves the issue without introducing new problems
4. Document the issue and resolution

### 3. Assess Test Coverage
We'll examine the test coverage report to ensure:
1. Coverage meets acceptable thresholds
2. Critical code paths are adequately tested
3. No significant gaps exist in the test suite

## Implementation Steps
1. Run `pnpm typecheck` to verify TypeScript type checking
2. Run `pnpm lint` to verify code linting
3. Run `pnpm format:check` to verify code formatting
4. Run `pnpm test` to verify tests pass
5. Run `pnpm test:coverage` to generate and assess coverage report
6. Fix any issues found during verification
7. Re-run verification steps after fixes
8. Document all issues found and their resolutions

## Verification Plan
1. All verification commands must complete with exit code 0
2. Manual review of coverage report to confirm adequate testing

## Expected Outcome
- All verification steps pass successfully
- Test coverage meets acceptable thresholds
- Project is ready for final manual browser testing (TEST-09)
