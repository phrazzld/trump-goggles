## Title: Fix TypeScript errors in test files

## Original Ticket Text:

- **Context:** TypeScript strict mode errors in test files blocking commits
- **Action:**
  1. Fix type errors in test/setup.ts (globals, imports, vitest types)
  2. Add proper type definitions for test utilities
  3. Fix mock implementations to match expected interfaces
- **Done‑when:**
  1. All test files pass TypeScript type checking
  2. Pre-commit hooks pass without --no-verify
- **Depends‑on:** [T014]
