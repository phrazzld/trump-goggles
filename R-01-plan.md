# R-01: Fix Duplicate Script Execution - Plan

## Issues to Fix

1. **TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'has')**
   - This error occurs in content.js because `window.trumpProcessedNodes` is being accessed before it's fully initialized
   - We need to ensure `window.trumpProcessedNodes` is properly initialized before any calls to its methods

2. **ReferenceError: Cannot access 'observerConfig' before initialization**
   - This error happens because the `observerConfig` variable is being accessed in the code before it's declared
   - We need to move the declaration of `observerConfig` to the top of the file

3. **Prevent Infinite Recursion in MutationObserver**
   - Ensure proper disconnect/reconnect of the MutationObserver during DOM modifications
   - Make sure node tracking is consistent across all operations

## Implementation Plan

1. Fix `window.trumpProcessedNodes` initialization:
   - Move the declaration to the very top of the file
   - Add defensive checks for existence of the object before accessing its methods
   
2. Fix `observerConfig` reference:
   - Move the declaration of the `observerConfig` object to the top of the file, before any code that references it
   - Make sure all references to `observerConfig` are properly scoped

3. Ensure MutationObserver doesn't cause infinite recursion:
   - Verify that `disconnect()` is called before making DOM changes 
   - Ensure `observe()` is called after the changes are complete
   - Add additional safeguards to check if nodes have been processed

4. Apply similar fixes to content-fixed.js if needed

These changes will fix the immediate errors and stabilize the extension until the more comprehensive refactoring described in the TODO.md file can be implemented.
