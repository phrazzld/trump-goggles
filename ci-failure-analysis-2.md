# CI Failure Analysis - Round 2

## Issue Overview
After fixing the pnpm store path issue, the CI workflow for PR #2 has failed with a new error:

```
Unsupported environment (bad pnpm and/or Node.js version)
Your Node version is incompatible with "registry.npmjs.org/eslint-plugin-vitest/0.5.4".
Expected version: ^18.0.0 || >= 20.0.0
Got: 16.0.0
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The eslint-plugin-vitest package requires Node.js version 18.0.0 or higher. Our current CI configuration is trying to test on both Node.js 16.x and 18.x, but 16.x is not compatible with our dependencies.

## Fix Recommendations

1. Update the CI workflow to only test on Node.js 18.x and 20.x:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node-version: [18.x, 20.x]
```

2. Update the package.json file to specify the correct Node.js version requirement:

```json
"engines": {
  "node": ">=18.0.0",
  "pnpm": ">=7.0.0"
},
```

3. Update the .npmrc file to use Node.js 18.0.0:

```
use-node-version=18.0.0
```

## Implementation Plan
1. Update the ci.yml file with the new Node.js versions
2. Update package.json to require Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
3. Update .npmrc to specify Node.js 18.0.0
4. Commit and push the changes
5. Re-run the GitHub Actions workflow
6. Verify that the CI passes successfully

These changes ensure that our CI workflow only runs on Node.js versions that are compatible with our dependencies.
