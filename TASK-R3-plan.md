# TASK-R3: Skip Replacements in Editable Fields

## Task Description
Modify the walk function to avoid processing editable elements. This will ensure that text inputs, textareas, and contentEditable elements are not modified by the text replacement functionality.

## Current Implementation Analysis
I need to analyze the current state of the codebase to determine if this functionality is already implemented or not.

### Current walk function:
- The walk function recursively traverses the DOM tree
- It processes text nodes (nodeType === 3) by calling the convert function
- There appears to be an isEditableNode function that checks if a node is editable
- Line 113 in content.js suggests there might already be a check to not process editable nodes

### Current isEditableNode function:
- Appears to check if a node is editable by examining:
  - If it's an input or textarea element
  - If it has contentEditable="true"
  - If any parent is editable (recursively)

## Testing Needed
1. Determine if the functionality is already implemented
2. If it is, verify it works correctly through testing
3. If not, implement it and write tests to verify correctness

## Implementation Plan
1. Examine content.js to evaluate the current implementation of walk and isEditableNode functions
2. Check the test files to see if there are tests for this functionality
3. If needed:
   - Enhance isEditableNode to properly identify all editable elements
   - Modify walk function to skip editable elements
   - Add tests to verify the behavior
4. Run all tests to ensure no regressions
5. Update TODO.md to reflect the implementation status
