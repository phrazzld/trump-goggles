# TEST-01: Perform Static Analysis

## Overview

This task involves running static analysis tools on the codebase to verify code quality. Specifically, we need to:

1. Run TypeScript check using `tsc --noEmit` to ensure type correctness
2. Run ESLint to check for coding style and potential issues
3. Address any remaining warnings or errors identified by these tools

The task is considered complete when all tools run without errors, except for justified, documented suppressions (such as the properly documented @ts-ignore directives we enhanced in CS-02).

## Implementation Plan

1. **Run TypeScript Check**:
   - Execute `npx tsc --noEmit`
   - Document any errors or warnings that appear
   - Determine which errors are justified suppressions and which need to be fixed

2. **Run ESLint**:
   - Execute `npx eslint .`
   - Document any errors or warnings that appear
   - Determine which are acceptable and which need to be fixed

3. **Address Issues**:
   - Fix any TypeScript errors that aren't justified suppressions
   - Fix any ESLint errors that aren't explicitly allowed
   - Document any suppressions that are kept and why they're necessary

4. **Verification**:
   - Re-run TypeScript check to ensure all unjustified errors are fixed
   - Re-run ESLint to ensure all unjustified errors are fixed
   - Confirm that any remaining suppressions are properly documented

## Potential Challenges

- Some errors might be challenging to fix without significant refactoring
- Some warnings might be false positives or related to third-party code
- ESLint might have configuration issues or missing rules

## Success Criteria

1. Running `npx tsc --noEmit` produces no errors except for justified @ts-ignore directives
2. Running `npx eslint .` produces no errors except for justified suppressions
3. All suppressions are properly documented with explanations of why they're necessary
4. The code quality has been improved by fixing any legitimate issues
