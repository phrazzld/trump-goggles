# TS-06: Define Types for Chrome/Browser API Interactions

## Task Summary
Define specific TypeScript types/interfaces for commonly used Chrome/Browser API structures in the global type definition file.

## Approach
1. Examine the existing code to identify which Chrome/Browser API structures are commonly used
2. Research official Chrome Extensions API documentation for accurate type definitions
3. Create detailed type definitions for these APIs in `types.d.ts`
4. Focus on APIs most relevant to this extension's functionality

## Steps
1. Review browser-adapter.js, background scripts, and other files to identify common API usages
2. Define types for chrome.runtime structures (Manifest, InstalledDetails)
3. Define types for chrome.storage interfaces and object structures
4. Define types for chrome.tabs interfaces
5. Define types for chrome.webRequest event objects if used
6. Define types for chrome.action/browserAction APIs
7. Add proper JSDoc comments to all type definitions
8. Run TypeScript type checking to validate the new type definitions

## Acceptance Criteria
- Types/interfaces for key browser API structures are defined
- The definitions accurately reflect API specifications from official documentation
- Type definitions are comprehensive enough to cover extension's needs
- Type definitions are properly documented with JSDoc comments
