# CI Resolution Plan

## Issue Summary
The CI build for PR #3 is failing because the GitHub Actions workflow cannot find download information for the `actions/upload-artifact@v3` action. This is likely because this version of the action is deprecated or no longer available.

## Resolution Approach
The most direct solution is to update the workflow file to use the current latest version of the upload-artifact action:

1. **Update Action Version**: 
   - Change from `actions/upload-artifact@v3` to `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
   - According to the GitHub Marketplace, v4 is the latest stable version of this action

2. **Verify Other Actions**:
   - While we're updating one action, we should check if any other actions used in the workflow should be updated
   - This includes:
     - `actions/checkout@v3` → Check for `actions/checkout@v4`
     - `actions/setup-node@v3` → Check for `actions/setup-node@v4`
     - `actions/cache@v3` → Check for `actions/cache@v4`

3. **Test the Changes**:
   - After updating the workflow file, we should push the changes and verify that the CI build passes

## Implementation Plan

1. Update the CI workflow file (.github/workflows/ci.yml):
   ```yaml
   # Change this line:
   - name: Upload Coverage Report
     uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
     
   # To this:
   - name: Upload Coverage Report
     uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
   ```

2. Consider updating other actions to their latest versions for consistency and to prevent similar issues in the future.

3. Push the changes to the same branch (new-nicknames-feature) to trigger a new CI run.

4. Verify that the CI build passes without errors.

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: This is a straightforward update to a GitHub Actions configuration
- The change only affects the CI process and doesn't modify any application code
- If the update doesn't resolve the issue, we can try:
  - Temporarily removing the upload step
  - Checking GitHub status for any reported issues with Actions
  - Testing with a minimal workflow to isolate the problem

## Long-term Recommendations
1. Periodically review and update GitHub Actions versions to prevent similar issues
2. Consider adding a maintenance task to review CI configuration quarterly
3. Set up notifications for GitHub Actions deprecations relevant to the project's workflows
