# CI-13 Plan: Fix Node.js 20.9.0 Compatibility Issue

## Task Description
Fix the Node.js 20.9.0 compatibility issue that is causing CI failures while builds pass on Node.js 18.18.0.

## Analysis

### Environment
- Package.json specifies Node.js compatibility as `"node": "^18.18.0 || ^20.9.0 || >=21.1.0"`
- CI is testing on both Node.js 18.18.0 and 20.9.0
- The CI workflow runs linting, type checking, and tests

### Potential Causes
There are several potential causes for the Node.js version incompatibility:

1. **Changes in ESM handling**: Node.js 20.9.0 might handle ES modules differently than 18.18.0
2. **TypeScript type checking issues**: Different Node.js versions might handle TypeScript slightly differently
3. **Test environment setup issues**: The test setup (in test/setup.js) might have compatibility issues with Node.js 20.9.0
4. **Dependency incompatibilities**: Some dependencies might not be fully compatible with Node.js 20.9.0

## Implementation Plan

1. **Investigate CI Logs**
   - Analyze detailed CI logs to pinpoint the exact failure in Node.js 20.9.0
   - Compare successful 18.18.0 build logs with failing 20.9.0 logs

2. **Test Reproduction**
   - Attempt to reproduce the issue locally by running tests with Node.js 20.9.0
   - Isolate which test(s) or process is failing

3. **Fix Implementation**
   - Address the specific incompatibility identified in the investigation
   - Update code or configurations as needed to ensure compatibility
   - Potential fixes:
     - Update ESM import/export syntax if needed
     - Fix test setup for compatibility with Node.js 20.9.0
     - Update TypeScript configuration
     - Update dependencies if needed

4. **Validation**
   - Run tests locally with both Node.js versions
   - Ensure CI pipeline passes on both versions

## Success Criteria
- CI builds pass on both Node.js 18.18.0 and 20.9.0
- No regression in functionality
- No changes to existing behavior
