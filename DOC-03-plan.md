# DOC-03: Align Trailing Comma Documentation with Prettier Config

## Task Summary
Update the documentation in CONTRIBUTING.md to ensure the trailing comma rule description accurately matches the project's Prettier configuration (`"trailingComma": "es5"`).

## Approach
1. Review current Prettier configuration to confirm the trailing comma setting
2. Find the "Formatting and Linting" section in CONTRIBUTING.md
3. Update the documentation to state that trailing commas are used "where valid in ES5 (objects, arrays, etc.)"
4. Ensure the update is clear and consistent with other style documentation

## Steps
1. Examine the Prettier configuration file or package.json for the current trailingComma setting
2. Open CONTRIBUTING.md and locate the "Formatting and Linting" section
3. Find any mentions of trailing commas in the documentation
4. Update the text to accurately describe the es5 trailing comma rule
5. Verify the documentation now correctly matches the Prettier configuration

## Acceptance Criteria
- The trailing comma rule description in CONTRIBUTING.md accurately matches the project's Prettier configuration
- The updated documentation is clear, consistent, and well-formatted
