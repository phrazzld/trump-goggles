# Tenet: Git as a Distributed System

Treat Git not just as version control, but as a distributed database with eventual consistency. Design workflows that embrace Git's distributed nature while maintaining consistency, availability, and partition tolerance across globally distributed teams.

## Core Belief

Git is fundamentally a distributed system, and thinking about it through this lens transforms how we approach version control at scale. Just as distributed databases must handle network partitions, conflicting updates, and eventual consistency, Git workflows must be designed to handle the reality of distributed teams working asynchronously across time zones, with varying network reliability, and different local states.

When you design Git workflows with distributed systems principles, you're acknowledging that perfect synchronization is impossible and that conflicts are not failures—they're a natural consequence of distributed work. The goal is not to prevent all conflicts but to make conflict resolution predictable, automatable, and recoverable. This mirrors how distributed databases handle concurrent updates: through well-defined merge strategies, conflict resolution policies, and robust recovery mechanisms.

Think of each developer's local repository as a node in a distributed database. These nodes can operate independently during network partitions (offline work), accumulate local state (commits), and eventually synchronize when connectivity is restored. The strength of this model is its resilience—work continues even when the central repository is unavailable, and the system self-heals when nodes reconnect.

The CAP theorem applies to Git workflows just as it does to distributed systems. You can optimize for consistency (strict linear history), availability (developers can always commit locally), or partition tolerance (work continues during network issues), but you can't have all three perfectly. Understanding these trade-offs allows you to design workflows that match your team's actual needs rather than fighting against Git's distributed nature.

## Practical Guidelines

1. **Design for Eventual Consistency**: Accept that perfect synchronization is impossible in distributed teams. Design workflows that handle temporary inconsistencies gracefully. Ask yourself: "What happens when two developers work on related features for a week without syncing?" Build processes that make eventual convergence smooth and predictable.

2. **Embrace Asynchronous Collaboration**: Structure work to minimize synchronous coordination points. Use feature flags to decouple deployment from release, allowing parallel development streams to merge without blocking each other. Consider: "How can we structure our work so that developers in different time zones never block each other?"

3. **Build Observable Git Workflows**: Just as distributed systems need comprehensive monitoring, Git workflows need visibility into their health. Track metrics like time-to-merge, conflict frequency, and rebase complexity. Ask: "How do we know our Git workflow is healthy? What are our SLIs for version control?"

4. **Implement Robust Conflict Resolution**: Design conflict resolution as a first-class concern, not an exceptional case. Establish clear ownership boundaries, automated conflict detection, and resolution playbooks. Consider: "When conflicts occur at 3 AM in a developer's time zone, can they resolve them without waking up the team?"

5. **Create Resilient Recovery Procedures**: Plan for failure modes: corrupted repositories, lost commits, and failed merges. Implement automated backups, commit signing, and recovery procedures. Ask: "If our central repository disappeared, how quickly could we reconstitute it from distributed copies?"

## Warning Signs

- **Treating the central repository as the single source of truth** without redundancy or backup strategies. This creates a single point of failure that violates distributed systems principles.

- **Workflows that require synchronous coordination** between team members in different time zones. If developers regularly say "I'm blocked waiting for someone to merge," your workflow isn't truly distributed.

- **Lack of visibility into Git workflow health**, such as having no metrics on merge conflicts, commit frequency, or branch lifetimes. Operating blind makes it impossible to optimize for reliability and performance.

- **Manual conflict resolution as the only strategy**, without tooling, automation, or clear procedures. This approach doesn't scale with team size or geographic distribution.

- **No disaster recovery procedures** for Git infrastructure. If you can't answer "How do we recover from a corrupted main branch?" you're not treating Git as a critical distributed system.

- **Fighting against Git's distributed nature** by trying to enforce perfectly linear history or preventing all conflicts. This is like trying to achieve perfect consistency in a distributed database—it comes at the cost of availability and partition tolerance.

## Related Tenets

- [Automation](automation.md): Distributed Git workflows require extensive automation to handle the complexity of asynchronous collaboration. Automated conflict detection, merge strategies, and recovery procedures are essential for reliability at scale.

- [Observability](observability.md): Just as distributed systems need comprehensive monitoring, distributed Git workflows need observability into their health and performance. Metrics and logging enable data-driven optimization of version control processes.

- [Adaptability and Reversibility](adaptability-and-reversibility.md): Distributed workflows must be adaptable to changing team dynamics and reversible when problems occur. The ability to recover from failed merges or corrupted history is crucial for maintaining system reliability.

- [Explicit over Implicit](explicit-over-implicit.md): In distributed systems, implicit assumptions about state or ordering lead to bugs. Git workflows must make merge strategies, conflict resolution policies, and recovery procedures explicit and well-documented.
