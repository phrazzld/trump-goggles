# Tenet: Git Reliability Engineering

Apply site reliability engineering principles to Git workflows. Treat version control as a critical production system that requires SLOs, error budgets, monitoring, and incident response procedures to maintain predictable performance and availability at scale.

## Core Belief

Version control is the backbone of software development, yet we rarely apply the same reliability engineering rigor to Git that we apply to production services. When Git workflows fail—through merge conflicts, corrupted repositories, or performance degradation—the entire development pipeline grinds to a halt. These failures cascade through the organization, blocking deployments, frustrating developers, and ultimately impacting product delivery.

By applying SRE principles to Git, we transform version control from a hoped-for utility into a guaranteed service. This means defining Service Level Objectives for Git operations: How quickly should clones complete? What's the acceptable conflict rate? How fast must we recover from repository corruption? These aren't academic exercises—they're commitments that enable predictable, reliable development velocity.

Think of Git reliability engineering as preventive medicine for your development pipeline. Just as SRE teams instrument production services to detect problems before users notice, we must instrument Git workflows to catch issues before they block developers. This includes monitoring repository size growth, tracking merge conflict patterns, and alerting on performance degradation. When you know your p99 clone time is creeping up, you can intervene before it becomes a crisis.

The error budget concept is particularly powerful for Git workflows. Instead of pursuing zero conflicts or perfect linear history—impossible goals that create brittleness—we accept that some level of conflicts and complexity is natural. By setting explicit targets (e.g., "less than 5% of merges should require manual conflict resolution"), we can balance development velocity with maintainability. When we exceed our error budget, we invest in tooling and process improvements rather than hoping the problem resolves itself.

## Practical Guidelines

1. **Define Git SLOs and SLIs**: Establish measurable objectives for Git operations. Track metrics like clone time, fetch latency, merge success rate, and conflict resolution time. Ask: "What Git performance would make developers genuinely happy? What would make them frustrated?" Use these thresholds as your SLOs.

2. **Implement Comprehensive Git Monitoring**: Monitor Git operations like you monitor production services. Track repository growth, ref advertisement time, pack file efficiency, and git protocol performance. Consider: "If Git performance degrades by 50%, how quickly would we know? Would we find out from metrics or developer complaints?"

3. **Build Git Incident Response Playbooks**: Document procedures for common Git failures: corrupted objects, rejected pushes, merge disasters, and performance crises. Include rollback procedures, recovery steps, and escalation paths. Ask: "Can a junior engineer resolve a Git incident at 2 AM using only our documentation?"

4. **Establish Git Error Budgets**: Accept that some Git friction is inevitable and budget for it explicitly. Set targets for acceptable conflict rates, merge complexity, and manual intervention frequency. When you exceed the budget, prioritize workflow improvements. Consider: "Are we spending our Git error budget on valuable experimentation or wasteful inefficiency?"

5. **Practice Git Disaster Recovery**: Regularly test recovery procedures: restore from backups, rebuild from distributed copies, recover lost commits. Treat these as you would disaster recovery drills for production systems. Ask: "If our Git infrastructure vanished, how long until development resumes? Have we actually tested this?"

## Warning Signs

- **No metrics on Git operations**, treating version control as an unmeasured black box. Without measurement, you can't improve reliability or even know when things are degrading.

- **Git problems discovered through developer complaints** rather than monitoring alerts. This reactive approach means issues impact productivity before they're addressed.

- **No documented Git incident procedures**, leaving teams to improvise during crises. Every Git disaster becomes a unique emergency rather than a handled scenario.

- **Pursuing perfection over reliability**, such as mandating zero conflicts or perfectly linear history. This creates brittle workflows that fail catastrophically rather than degrading gracefully.

- **No Git performance budgets or capacity planning**, leading to gradual degradation as repositories grow. The boiling frog problem: performance degrades so slowly that teams adapt rather than fix.

- **Treating Git failures as one-off events** rather than systematic issues requiring process improvement. If you're not doing postmortems on Git incidents, you're not learning from failures.

## Related Tenets

- [Observability](observability.md): Git reliability engineering requires deep observability into version control operations. Without metrics, logs, and traces, you cannot build reliable Git workflows or diagnose problems effectively.

- [Automation](automation.md): Reliable Git workflows demand automation for monitoring, alerting, and recovery procedures. Manual processes cannot provide the consistency and speed required for true reliability engineering.

- [Fix Broken Windows](fix-broken-windows.md): Git reliability issues often start small—a slow clone here, an occasional conflict there—before cascading into major problems. Addressing issues promptly prevents the normalization of degraded performance.

- [Document Decisions](document-decisions.md): Git incident procedures, runbooks, and architectural decisions must be thoroughly documented. During a Git crisis, clear documentation can mean the difference between quick recovery and extended downtime.
