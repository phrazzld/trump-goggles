# Tenet: Git's Principle of Least Surprise

Git workflows and conventions should behave exactly as developers expect them to. Minimize surprises, make outcomes predictable, and ensure that the mental model matches the actual behavior. When Git works intuitively, developers can focus on their code rather than their tools.

## Core Belief

The principle of least surprise, fundamental to Ruby's design philosophy, applies powerfully to version control. When Git behaves predictably and intuitively, it becomes an extension of developer thought rather than an obstacle to it. Every surprise in Git—every unexpected behavior, every command that doesn't do what its name suggests, every workflow that defies intuition—is a small betrayal of developer trust that compounds into frustration and lost productivity.

Git surprises are particularly costly because they often occur at moments of high cognitive load. When a developer is deep in solving a problem, an unexpected Git behavior forces an expensive context switch. They must stop thinking about their solution, figure out what Git did and why, fix the unexpected state, and then try to recover their original train of thought. This disruption is like being woken from a dream—the cost isn't just the time spent dealing with the surprise, but the difficulty of returning to the creative flow state.

Consider how we name things in everyday life. A door handle suggests pulling, a flat plate suggests pushing. When these affordances match their function, we move through the world effortlessly. When they don't—when a pull handle is on a push door—we experience frustration and confusion. Git should follow these same principles of intuitive design. Branch names should clearly indicate their purpose, commands should do what their names suggest, and workflows should follow patterns that developers can predict based on their existing mental models.

The least surprise principle in Git isn't about dumbing down or avoiding powerful features. It's about ensuring that power is wielded predictably. Just as Ruby provides powerful metaprogramming capabilities that still behave according to consistent, predictable rules, Git workflows can be both sophisticated and unsurprising. The key is consistency, clarity, and respect for developer expectations built from their broader programming experience.

## Practical Guidelines

1. **Use Descriptive, Predictable Names**: Choose branch names, tag formats, and aliases that immediately convey their purpose and behavior. A branch named `feature/user-authentication` tells a clear story, while `john-work-branch` surprises and confuses. Establish naming conventions that allow developers to predict content and purpose from names alone. Ask yourself: "If a developer saw this name with no other context, would they correctly guess what it represents and how to interact with it?"

2. **Make Workflows Match Mental Models**: Design Git workflows that align with how developers naturally think about their work progressing. If developers think of features as moving from development to testing to production, your branch strategy should reflect this linear progression. Avoid workflows that require mental gymnastics or counterintuitive operations. Ask yourself: "Does this workflow match how developers conceptually understand their work moving through stages?"

3. **Provide Consistent Command Patterns**: Ensure that similar Git operations use similar command structures and options. If `--force` means "override safety checks" in one context, it should mean the same thing everywhere. Create aliases and scripts that provide consistent interfaces to complex operations. Ask yourself: "Will developers be able to guess how to do something based on how they do similar things?"

4. **Fail Safely and Informatively**: When things go wrong, Git should fail in ways that protect developer work and clearly explain what happened. Error messages should be helpful, suggesting next steps rather than just stating problems. Dangerous operations should require confirmation and explain their consequences. Ask yourself: "If this operation fails or does something unexpected, will the developer understand what happened and know how to proceed?"

5. **Document Intentions, Not Just Actions**: Use commit messages, branch descriptions, and PR templates to capture the why behind changes, not just the what. When developers understand intentions, they can predict how code will evolve and make decisions that align with those intentions. Ask yourself: "Will future developers understand not just what changed, but why it changed and what we were trying to achieve?"

6. **Maintain Workflow Consistency**: Once you establish patterns, stick to them. Exceptions and special cases are sources of surprise that break developer flow. If feature branches are usually named `feature/description`, don't suddenly use `feat-description` or `new-feature-description`. Consistency allows developers to work on autopilot for routine operations. Ask yourself: "Are we maintaining our established patterns, or are we introducing surprising variations?"

## Warning Signs

- **Developers frequently asking "Why did Git do that?"** indicates that Git's behavior doesn't match their mental model. When Git surprises developers, it means workflows aren't intuitive or well-communicated.

- **Confusion about branch purposes or states** such as developers working on the wrong branch or being unsure what a branch contains. If branch names and workflows don't make purposes obvious, you're violating least surprise.

- **Frequent need to explain Git workflows** to team members who should already understand them. If you're repeatedly explaining the same concepts, your workflows are not intuitive enough.

- **Developers avoiding certain Git features** because they're unpredictable or have bitten them before. When developers stick to a minimal set of "safe" commands, it indicates that other commands have surprised them unpleasantly.

- **Inconsistent command usage patterns** where similar operations require different approaches. If developers can't predict how to do something based on similar operations, you're creating surprise.

- **Git commands that don't do what their names suggest** such as aliases that mislead or scripts that have unexpected side effects. When the name says one thing but the behavior is another, you create dangerous surprises.

- **Recovery from mistakes requires expert knowledge** rather than following intuitive patterns. If developers can't guess how to undo something based on how they did it, your workflows violate least surprise.

## Related Tenets

- [Explicit over Implicit](explicit-over-implicit.md): Making Git behaviors explicit reduces surprises. When workflows clearly state their intentions and effects, developers know exactly what to expect.

- [Joyful Version Control](joyful-version-control.md): Least surprise is a key component of developer happiness. When Git behaves predictably, developers feel confident and comfortable, contributing to overall joy in using version control.

- [Simplicity](simplicity.md): Simple Git workflows are inherently less surprising because they have fewer edge cases and special behaviors. Complexity breeds surprise, while simplicity promotes predictability.

- [Build Trust Through Collaboration](build-trust-through-collaboration.md): Predictable Git workflows build trust within teams. When everyone can rely on Git behaving consistently, they can collaborate with confidence rather than fear of unexpected behaviors.
