# Tenet: Design for Testability

Code must be structured to enable comprehensive, reliable testing from the beginning.
Testability is not an afterthought or a luxury—it's a fundamental design constraint that
shapes architecture, reveals design flaws, and ensures long-term maintainability.

## Core Belief

Testable code is inherently better code. When you design your systems with testability
in mind, you're not just making testing easier—you're creating cleaner architecture,
reducing coupling, clarifying responsibilities, and forcing yourself to think through
edge cases and error scenarios. Testability serves as a powerful feedback mechanism that
improves your design decisions before you even write a test.

Think of tests like guardrails on a mountain road. They don't just protect you when you
venture too close to the edge—they give you the confidence to drive faster and take more
direct routes because you know you're protected from disaster. Similarly, a
comprehensive test suite gives you the confidence to refactor aggressively, integrate
frequently, and deploy continuously, without fear that you'll introduce regressions or
destabilize the system.

The pain of testing is diagnostic. If testing a component feels difficult, complicated,
or requires elaborate setup, that's a clear signal that the underlying design needs
improvement. When you encounter resistance in testing, don't work around it with complex
test infrastructure—fix the design issue at its source. This principle means that
testability becomes not just a quality attribute but an active design force that pushes
your code toward better structure.

Testability is not about reaching arbitrary coverage numbers or following rigid testing
methodologies. It's about using tests strategically to build confidence in your system's
behavior and protect against regressions. The ultimate goal is reliable software that
can evolve safely over time, with tests serving as both a safety net and living
documentation of the system's intended behavior.

## Practical Guidelines

1. **Test-Driven Development When Appropriate**: Consider writing tests before
   implementation, especially for complex logic or critical functionality. This approach
   naturally leads to more testable designs and clearer requirements. Ask yourself: "Do
   I fully understand what this component needs to do?" If not, writing tests first can
   help clarify your thinking. TDD isn't always necessary, but when requirements are
   complex or specifications are unclear, it provides a powerful way to think through
   the problem space methodically.

1. **Structure for Testability**: Organize code with clear interfaces, dependency
   inversion, separation of concerns, and pure functions to enable easy verification.
   Design decisions should consider testing implications from the start. Ask yourself:
   "How will this design decision impact our ability to test this component?" Prefer
   architectures that naturally support isolation and independent testing of components.
   Function parameters should be explicit rather than pulled from ambient context, side
   effects should be minimized, and dependencies should be injectable.

1. **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus tests on what the code should do (public
   API, behavior), not how it does it (internal implementation). Implementation details
   can and will change, but the behavior should remain consistent. Ask yourself: "Will
   this test break if I refactor the implementation without changing the external
   behavior?" Your tests should verify outcomes, not mechanisms. If your tests are
   tightly coupled to implementation details, they'll become a hindrance to refactoring
   rather than an enabler.

1. **Refactor First, Not Last**: If code is difficult to test, this is a signal to
   refactor the code under test rather than creating complex test setups or mocking
   frameworks. The difficulty in testing is revealing a design problem that should be
   addressed before proceeding. Ask yourself: "Why is this code hard to test?" The
   answer often points to problems like tight coupling, mixed concerns, or hidden
   dependencies that should be resolved in your production code, not worked around in
   your test code.

1. **No Mocking Internal Components**: Mocking should only be used at true external
   system boundaries (databases, APIs, file systems, etc.). The need to mock internal
   collaborators indicates a design problem—likely tight coupling or unclear boundaries.
   Ask yourself: "Am I mocking this because it's truly external to my system, or because
   my components are too entangled?" Mock objects should represent things outside your
   control, not convenient substitutes for internal components. If you feel compelled to
   mock an internal component, consider instead refactoring to better encapsulate that
   functionality.

1. **Apply Ruthless Testing Standards**: Be uncompromising about test quality and
   coverage for critical business logic. Ask yourself: "What happens if this code fails
   in production?" Test every edge case, error condition, and boundary you can think of.
   Don't settle for "it probably works" or "we'll catch issues later." For core
   functionality that users depend on, aim for comprehensive coverage that gives you
   absolute confidence in correctness. This doesn't mean testing every trivial getter,
   but it does mean exhaustively validating the components that matter most. When in
   doubt, err on the side of more testing rather than less.

1. **Test All Meaningful States**: Systematically verify behavior across all significant
   states your system can be in. Ask yourself: "What are all the possible states this
   component can be in, and have I tested transitions between them?" Many bugs occur
   during state transitions or in unusual but valid system states. Create test cases
   that exercise initialization, steady-state operation, error recovery, shutdown, and
   edge conditions. For stateful components, test both successful and failed state
   transitions. Don't just test the happy path—test the entire state space that your
   users might encounter.

1. **Leverage Property-Based Testing**: Complement example-based tests with
   property-based tests that verify invariants hold across many inputs. Ask yourself:
   "What properties should always be true regardless of the specific input?" Rather than
   testing individual examples, define rules that must hold for entire classes of
   inputs, then let the testing framework generate hundreds of test cases automatically.
   This approach often uncovers edge cases you wouldn't think to test manually. Use
   property-based testing for algorithms, data transformations, and any logic where you
   can express invariants or relationships that should always hold true.

## Warning Signs

- **Test setup requires complex mocking and stubbing** of internal collaborators to
  isolate the unit under test. When you need elaborate mock objects, stub chains, or
  test-specific infrastructure to test a component, it's a strong indicator that your
  production code has coupling issues. If it's difficult to isolate a unit for testing,
  it will be equally difficult to isolate it for maintenance or replacement.

- **Tests are brittle, breaking with minor implementation changes** even when external
  behavior remains consistent. Fragile tests indicate they're testing implementation
  details rather than behavior. These tests become a burden rather than an asset,
  discouraging refactoring and generating mistrust in the test suite. Listen for
  developers saying "I made a minor change and 20 tests broke" as a warning sign.

- **Tests require knowledge of implementation details** to write or understand them. If
  you can't write a test without understanding the internal workings of the component,
  the test is too coupled to implementation. Good tests should read like documentation
  of how to use the component, not expositions of how it's built. They should express
  intent and expected behavior clearly.

- **Code uses global state, static methods, or singletons** that make it difficult to
  set up isolated test conditions. These patterns create hidden dependencies and shared
  state that introduce test order dependencies and make it challenging to ensure
  consistent test environments. When you hear "this test only passes when run in
  isolation" or "this test fails when run with others," it's often due to shared state
  issues.

- **Test coverage is low in core business logic** despite high overall coverage numbers.
  This pattern often indicates teams are testing what's easy to test rather than what's
  important to test. Critical business rules and complex logic should have the highest
  test coverage, not the simplest utility functions. Coverage should be distributed
  according to risk and complexity, not convenience.

- **Testing requires complex, hard-to-understand test doubles** that mimic the behavior
  of real components. When your test doubles become complex, it suggests your real
  components might be doing too much or have unclear responsibilities. Simple components
  generally require simple test doubles.

- **Integration tests are used to compensate for untestable units**. While integration
  tests are valuable for verifying component interaction, they shouldn't be used as a
  workaround for poorly designed units that can't be tested in isolation. This approach
  leads to slow, flaky test suites that provide poor feedback and debugging information.

- **Critical business logic resides in untestable places** like UI event handlers,
  database triggers, or background jobs. Business rules should be extracted into
  testable units, independent of their delivery mechanism or execution context. When
  important logic is embedded in framework code or infrastructure components, it's both
  difficult to test and to reuse.

## Related Tenets

- [Modularity](modularity.md): Modularity and testability reinforce each other—properly
  modularized code with clear boundaries and minimal dependencies is naturally easier to
  test. Similarly, striving for testability pushes your design toward better
  modularization. When a component is difficult to test in isolation, it's often a sign
  of poor module boundaries or excessive coupling.

- [Simplicity](simplicity.md): Testable code tends to be simpler code. The act of making
  code testable often forces you to clarify responsibilities, reduce coupling, and
  eliminate unnecessary complexity. Conversely, simpler code with fewer moving parts and
  clearer intent is inherently easier to test. Both tenets push your design in the same
  direction.

- [Explicit over Implicit](explicit-over-implicit.md): Testability requires
  explicitness. Hidden assumptions, implicit dependencies, and invisible state make code
  both harder to understand and harder to test. Making dependencies and behaviors
  explicit improves both testability and code clarity.

- [Maintainability](maintainability.md): Testability is a key enabler for long-term
  maintainability. A comprehensive test suite gives you the confidence to make changes
  without fear of breaking existing functionality. It also serves as living
  documentation that helps new team members understand how the system is supposed to
  behave.
