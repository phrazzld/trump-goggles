# Tenet: Content-Addressable History

Embrace Git's fundamental design as a content-addressable filesystem with a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of immutable objects. Structure repositories and workflows to leverage—not fight—this architecture for maximum performance, integrity, and clarity.

## Core Belief

Git's power stems from its elegant foundation: every piece of content (blobs, trees, commits) is identified by a SHA-1 hash of its contents, creating an immutable, verifiable history. This isn't just an implementation detail—it's the key to Git's reliability, performance, and distributed nature. When you understand and work with this model, rather than against it, you unlock Git's full potential.

Think of Git not as a version control system, but as a database of immutable objects linked in a DAG. Each commit points to a tree (representing the complete state of your project) and zero or more parent commits. This structure provides perfect deduplication, cryptographic integrity verification, and efficient storage through delta compression. But more importantly, it enables powerful operations like bisecting, cherry-picking, and rebasing that would be impossible or expensive in other models.

The content-addressable nature means identical content is stored only once, regardless of how many times it appears across different commits or branches. A 10MB file that remains unchanged across 1000 commits occupies only 10MB in the repository. This efficiency extends to partial changes—Git's packfile format stores deltas between similar objects, achieving remarkable compression ratios.

Understanding this architecture transforms how you approach version control. Instead of thinking about "changes to files," think about "snapshots of project state connected in a graph." This mental model leads to better commit practices, more efficient repository structures, and workflows that leverage Git's strengths rather than working around perceived limitations.

## Practical Guidelines

1. **Design Commits as Nodes in a Graph**: Each commit should represent a complete, meaningful state of your project. Ask yourself: "If someone checks out this commit in isolation, will they have a coherent, working system?" This approach enables powerful debugging through bisection and makes your history a valuable development tool, not just an audit log.

2. **Leverage Content Deduplication**: Structure your repository to maximize Git's natural deduplication. Keep large binary assets that change frequently in separate repositories or use Git LFS. When refactoring, preserve file identity when possible—Git tracks content, but also uses paths for delta compression heuristics.

3. **Optimize for Common Ancestry**: Design branching strategies that maintain clear common ancestors. The more divergent your branches, the harder Git must work to compute merges and diffs. Short-lived feature branches that regularly incorporate upstream changes maintain closer ancestry and result in cleaner merges and better performance.

4. **Respect Object Immutability**: Never rewrite published history. Once a commit is shared, it becomes part of an immutable ledger that others depend on. Rewriting history doesn't delete objects—it creates new ones and orphans the old, leading to confusion and bloated repositories. Use rebase and amend only on private branches.

5. **Structure for Efficient Cloning**: Organize repositories so partial clones and sparse checkouts are effective. Monorepos can work well with Git when properly structured—keep independent components in separate subdirectories, allowing developers to clone only what they need using sparse checkout patterns.

6. **Exploit SHA-1 for Verification**: Use Git's content addressing for build reproducibility and deployment verification. A commit SHA precisely identifies not just the change, but the entire state of the repository at that point. Tag releases with annotated tags (which are themselves content-addressed objects) for cryptographically verifiable release points.

7. **Maintain Graph Simplicity**: While Git supports arbitrarily complex DAGs, simpler graphs are faster to traverse and easier to understand. Avoid unnecessary merge commits (use fast-forward when appropriate), and consider squash-merging feature branches that contain many small "WIP" commits to maintain a cleaner mainline history.

## Warning Signs

- **Treating Git like a centralized VCS** by maintaining excessively long-lived branches or requiring all operations go through a central server. This fights Git's distributed nature and creates bottlenecks.

- **Storing generated files or dependencies** in the repository. This bloats history with non-essential content that changes frequently, defeating Git's deduplication.

- **Giant commits that change everything** instead of focused, atomic commits. This makes bisecting impossible and reviews difficult.

- **Rewriting public history** causing synchronization problems and confused collaborators. Once published, commits should be considered immutable.

- **Deep, tangled merge graphs** from poor branch management. Complex graphs slow down operations and make history hard to understand.

- **Committing large binary files directly** without considering Git LFS or alternative storage. Binary files don't delta compress well and bloat repository size.

- **Using commits as backup storage** with messages like "WIP" or "savepoint". This clutters history and makes the commit graph less useful as a debugging tool.

- **Fighting Git's snapshot model** by trying to track individual file changes rather than repository states. Git stores snapshots, not deltas.

## Performance Implications

Understanding Git's content-addressable model directly impacts repository performance:

- **Pack files**: Git periodically compresses objects into pack files using delta compression. Keeping related content together improves compression ratios.

- **Commit-graph files**: Modern Git can precompute and cache commit graph information. Simpler graphs with good locality benefit most from this optimization.

- **Partial clone**: Leveraging Git's object model allows cloning only needed objects, dramatically reducing clone times for large repositories.

- **Shallow clones**: Understanding the DAG structure helps determine optimal shallow clone depths for CI/CD systems.

- **Reference advertisement**: During fetch/push, Git must advertise all references. Thousands of stale branches slow down every network operation.
