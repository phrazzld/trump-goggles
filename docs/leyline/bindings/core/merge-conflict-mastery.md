# Binding: Master Merge Conflicts Through Prevention and Clear Resolution

Treat merge conflicts not as inevitable disasters but as communication failures that can be prevented through better practices. When conflicts do occur, resolve them with clear understanding rather than guesswork, maintaining code integrity throughout the process.

## Rationale

This binding implements our explicit-over-implicit tenet by making merge conflict resolution a deliberate, understood process rather than a mysterious trial-and-error exercise. Too many developers treat merge conflicts like landmines‚Äîunexpected explosions that derail their work. In reality, conflicts are Git's way of saying "I need human judgment here," and they're entirely predictable based on how code changes overlap.

The fear of merge conflicts leads to counterproductive behaviors: developers avoid rebasing, maintain long-lived branches to "avoid conflicts," or worse, blindly accept one side of a conflict without understanding the implications. This fear-driven development creates exactly the problems it tries to avoid‚Äîthe longer branches diverge, the more painful the eventual integration becomes.

By understanding why conflicts occur and establishing clear practices for both prevention and resolution, we transform conflicts from workflow disruptions into manageable communication points. A conflict is just Git telling you that two developers modified the same area of code‚Äîit's an opportunity to ensure both changes are properly integrated, not a crisis to be resolved as quickly as possible.

## Rule Definition

**Conflict Prevention Strategies:**

- **Frequent Integration**: Rebase or merge from main at least daily
- **Small, Focused Changes**: Limit the surface area for conflicts
- **Communication**: Coordinate on files likely to conflict
- **Architectural Boundaries**: Structure code to minimize conflict zones
- **Automated Formatting**: Consistent formatting reduces trivial conflicts

**Conflict Resolution Principles:**

- **Understand Both Sides**: Never resolve conflicts without understanding both changes
- **Preserve Intent**: Ensure the resolution maintains the intent of both changes
- **Test After Resolution**: Always run tests after resolving conflicts
- **Document Complex Resolutions**: Add comments when resolution isn't obvious
- **Never Use `--ours` or `--theirs` Blindly**: These flags hide important decisions

**Structural Conflict Minimization:**

- **File Organization**: Many small files conflict less than few large files
- **Interface Stability**: Stable interfaces reduce integration conflicts
- **Feature Flags**: Decouple feature development from integration
- **Append-Only Patterns**: Adding rather than modifying reduces conflicts

## Practical Implementation

1. **Configure Git for Better Conflict Resolution**: Set up Git to provide maximum information during conflicts:

   ```bash
   # Better diff algorithm for fewer false conflicts
   git config --global diff.algorithm histogram

   # Show common ancestor in conflicts (3-way merge)
   git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3

   # Better rename detection
   git config --global diff.renames true
   git config --global diff.renameLimit 999999

   # Use better merge strategies
   git config --global pull.rebase true
   git config --global rebase.autoStash true
   ```

2. **Prevent Conflicts Through Workflow**: Design workflows that minimize conflict potential:

   ```bash
   # Daily integration pattern
   #!/bin/bash
   # morning-sync.sh

   # Stash any work in progress
   git stash push -m "WIP: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"

   # Update main
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main

   # Update feature branch
   git checkout feature/my-feature
   git rebase main

   # Restore work in progress
   git stash pop

   # If conflicts occurred during rebase, you handle them
   # with full context while changes are still fresh
   ```

3. **Resolve Conflicts with Context**: When conflicts occur, resolve them systematically:

   ```bash
   # When conflict occurs, understand the situation
   git status  # See conflicted files
   git log --merge --oneline  # See commits involved
   git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U  # List only conflicted files

   # For each conflicted file, understand both changes
   git log -p --merge -- path/to/conflicted.file

   # Use tools to visualize conflicts
   git mergetool  # Or use IDE merge tools

   # After resolution, verify the result
   git diff --staged  # Review what you're about to commit
   npm test  # Ensure tests still pass

   # Commit with clear message about resolution
   git commit -m "merge: resolve auth conflict by combining validation approaches"
   ```

4. **Structure Code to Minimize Conflicts**: Architecture decisions that reduce merge pain:

   ```javascript
   // ‚ùå BAD: Single configuration object everyone modifies
   // config.js
   export const config = {
     apiUrl: 'http://localhost:3000',
     timeout: 5000,
     retries: 3,
     // Everyone adds here, constant conflicts
     feature1: { ... },
     feature2: { ... },
   };

   // ‚úÖ GOOD: Modular configuration
   // config/index.js
   export { apiConfig } from './api.config.js';
   export { authConfig } from './auth.config.js';
   export { uiConfig } from './ui.config.js';

   // Teams can work on separate config files
   // Conflicts only when modifying same domain
   ```

5. **Handle Complex Conflict Patterns**: Strategies for specific conflict types:

   ```bash
   # File rename conflicts
   # When one branch renames a file another modifies
   git status
   # both modified:   old-name.js
   # both modified:   new-name.js

   # Resolve by understanding the rename
   git log --follow --name-status -- old-name.js
   # Apply changes to the renamed file
   git rm old-name.js
   git add new-name.js

   # Semantic conflicts (no textual conflict but logic conflicts)
   # Set up CI to catch these
   # test/integration/semantic-conflict-detection.test.js
   test('payment and discount features work together', () => {
     // Test that independently developed features
     // don't break when combined
   });

   # Large refactoring conflicts
   # Use feature flags to decouple
   if (FEATURE_FLAGS.useNewArchitecture) {
     // New architecture code
   } else {
     // Old architecture code
   }
   # Merge both, remove flag when stable
   ```

## Examples

```bash
# ‚ùå BAD: Avoiding integration until the last moment
git checkout -b feature/big-refactor
# Work for 2 weeks without syncing
git checkout main
git merge feature/big-refactor
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in 47 files
# üò± Panic mode activated

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Continuous integration
git checkout -b feature/big-refactor
# Day 1
git commit -m "refactor: extract user service"
git rebase main  # Small conflict, easy to resolve
# Day 2
git commit -m "refactor: update user controller"
git rebase main  # No conflicts
# Small, manageable integration points
```

```diff
# ‚ùå BAD: Blind conflict resolution
<<<<<<< HEAD
function calculatePrice(item) {
  return item.price * 1.2;  // Added tax
=======
function calculatePrice(item) {
  return item.price * 0.9;  // Added discount
>>>>>>> feature/discount
}

# Developer just picks one side:
function calculatePrice(item) {
  return item.price * 0.9;  // Lost the tax logic!
}

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Understanding both changes
function calculatePrice(item) {
  // Both tax and discount need to be applied
  const withTax = item.price * 1.2;
  const withDiscount = withTax * 0.9;
  return withDiscount;
}
```

```bash
# ‚ùå BAD: Using merge strategies to hide conflicts
git merge feature-branch -X ours
# Silently discards changes from feature-branch
# No one realizes functionality was lost

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Explicit conflict resolution
git merge feature-branch
# CONFLICT: automatic merge failed
# Review each conflict carefully
git mergetool
# Test the resolution
npm test
# Document why specific resolutions were chosen
git commit -m "merge: combine auth flows, keeping OAuth2 as primary"
```
