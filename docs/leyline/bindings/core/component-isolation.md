# Binding: Design Independent, Self-Contained Components

Create components that operate independently without requiring knowledge of or dependencies on unrelated components. Each component should encapsulate its own state, behavior, and data, allowing it to be understood, tested, and modified in isolation.

## Rationale

This binding directly implements our orthogonality tenet by eliminating unwanted coupling between components. When components are truly isolated, changing one component doesn't create ripple effects throughout the system. This isolation dramatically reduces the cognitive load required to understand and modify code, as developers can focus on one component at a time without needing to understand the entire system.

Think of well-isolated components like appliances in your home. Your refrigerator doesn't need to know anything about your washing machine to function properly, and replacing your refrigerator doesn't affect your washing machine's operation. Similarly, isolated software components can be replaced, upgraded, or modified without affecting other parts of the system. This independence enables parallel development, easier testing, and safer refactoring.

The alternative—tightly coupled components—creates a web of dependencies where touching one part of the system requires understanding and potentially modifying many others. This coupling multiplies complexity exponentially and makes systems brittle, difficult to test, and expensive to maintain. By designing for isolation from the start, you create a system where complexity remains manageable even as the codebase grows.

## Rule Definition

Component isolation requires adherence to these core principles:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component must have exactly one reason to change and one clear purpose. Avoid components that handle multiple unrelated concerns.

- **Explicit Dependencies**: All dependencies must be explicitly declared and injected rather than accessed through global state or hidden imports. The component's interface should clearly communicate what it needs to operate.

- **No Shared Mutable State**: Components must not share mutable state directly. Communication should happen through well-defined interfaces using message passing, events, or function calls with immutable data.

- **Encapsulated Internal State**: Internal implementation details must be hidden from other components. Only expose the minimum necessary interface for the component to fulfill its purpose.

- **Minimal Interface Surface**: Keep the public interface as small as possible while still providing necessary functionality. Large interfaces create more coupling opportunities and are harder to maintain.

- **Stateless When Possible**: Prefer stateless components that transform inputs to outputs without maintaining internal state. When state is necessary, manage it explicitly and locally.

Exceptions to these rules may be appropriate when:
- Performance profiling demonstrates a genuine need for direct communication
- Legacy integration requires temporary coupling during migration
- Framework constraints make perfect isolation impractical

Such exceptions should be documented, minimized in scope, and addressed in future refactoring efforts.

## Practical Implementation

1. **Apply Dependency Injection**: Make all external dependencies explicit by injecting them through constructor parameters or method arguments. This makes dependencies visible in the component's interface and enables easy substitution for testing or different configurations.

2. **Use Message Passing for Communication**: Instead of direct method calls between unrelated components, use event systems, message queues, or observer patterns. This allows components to communicate without knowing about each other's internal structure.

3. **Implement Interface Segregation**: Create focused interfaces that expose only the methods and properties relevant to specific use cases. Avoid large, monolithic interfaces that force components to depend on functionality they don't use.

4. **Establish Clear Boundaries**: Define explicit boundaries around related functionality using modules, packages, or services. These boundaries should align with business concepts rather than technical layers, making it natural for related functionality to be grouped together.

5. **Design for Replaceability**: Structure components so they can be replaced with alternative implementations without affecting other parts of the system. This replaceability serves as a litmus test for good isolation—if replacing a component requires changes throughout the system, it's not properly isolated.

## Examples

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Tightly coupled user service with hidden dependencies
class UserService {
  async createUser(userData: any) {
    // Hidden dependency on specific database implementation
    const user = await PostgresDB.users.create(userData);

    // Hidden dependency on specific email service
    await SendgridEmail.send(user.email, 'Welcome!');

    // Hidden dependency on specific logger
    AppLogger.info(`User created: ${user.id}`);

    // Direct access to unrelated component
    AnalyticsTracker.track('user_created', { userId: user.id });

    return user;
  }
}

// ✅ GOOD: Isolated component with explicit dependencies
interface UserRepository {
  create(userData: UserData): Promise<User>;
}

interface EmailService {
  sendWelcomeEmail(email: string): Promise<void>;
}

interface Logger {
  info(message: string, context?: object): void;
}

interface EventPublisher {
  publish(event: string, data: object): void;
}

class UserService {
  constructor(
    private userRepo: UserRepository,
    private emailService: EmailService,
    private logger: Logger,
    private eventPublisher: EventPublisher
  ) {}

  async createUser(userData: UserData): Promise<User> {
    try {
      const user = await this.userRepo.create(userData);

      // Each dependency is explicit and substitutable
      await this.emailService.sendWelcomeEmail(user.email);
      this.logger.info('User created successfully', { userId: user.id });
      this.eventPublisher.publish('user.created', { userId: user.id });

      return user;
    } catch (error) {
      this.logger.error('Failed to create user', { error, userData });
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

```javascript
// ❌ BAD: Components sharing mutable state
let globalOrderState = {
  items: [],
  total: 0,
  discounts: []
};

class OrderCalculator {
  addItem(item) {
    globalOrderState.items.push(item);
    globalOrderState.total += item.price;
  }

  getTotal() {
    return globalOrderState.total;
  }
}

class DiscountEngine {
  applyDiscount(discount) {
    globalOrderState.discounts.push(discount);
    globalOrderState.total -= discount.amount;
  }
}

// ✅ GOOD: Isolated components with message passing
class OrderCalculator {
  calculateTotal(items) {
    return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
  }

  addItem(currentItems, newItem) {
    return [...currentItems, newItem];
  }
}

class DiscountEngine {
  calculateDiscount(total, discountRules) {
    return discountRules.reduce((discount, rule) => {
      return discount + this.applyRule(total, rule);
    }, 0);
  }

  private applyRule(total, rule) {
    if (rule.type === 'percentage') {
      return total * (rule.value / 100);
    }
    return rule.value;
  }
}

// Orchestrator manages state and coordinates components
class OrderService {
  constructor(calculator, discountEngine, eventBus) {
    this.calculator = calculator;
    this.discountEngine = discountEngine;
    this.eventBus = eventBus;
  }

  processOrder(items, discountRules) {
    const subtotal = this.calculator.calculateTotal(items);
    const discount = this.discountEngine.calculateDiscount(subtotal, discountRules);
    const total = subtotal - discount;

    const order = { items, subtotal, discount, total };

    // Publish event for other components to react
    this.eventBus.publish('order.calculated', order);

    return order;
  }
}

- [interface-contracts.md](../../docs/bindings/core/interface-contracts.md): Component isolation and interface contracts work together to define clear boundaries between components. While isolation focuses on independence, interface contracts specify how isolated components can communicate safely and predictably.

- [system-boundaries.md](../../docs/bindings/core/system-boundaries.md): System boundaries provide the higher-level architectural context for component isolation. Individual components should be isolated within their bounded contexts, while system boundaries define how those contexts interact.

- [dependency-inversion.md](../../docs/bindings/core/dependency-inversion.md): Dependency inversion enables component isolation by ensuring components depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. This allows components to be truly independent and substitutable.

- [pure-functions.md](../../docs/bindings/core/pure-functions.md): Pure functions are naturally isolated components at the function level. The principles of isolation apply both to larger architectural components and to individual functions within those components.
