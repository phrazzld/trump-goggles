# Binding: Avoid Premature Abstraction and Over-Engineering

Resist the urge to create abstractions before you understand the true pattern. Concrete, duplicated code that's easy to understand is better than the wrong abstraction that's difficult to change. Apply the "Rule of Three" and wait for genuine complexity before introducing layers of indirection.

## Rationale

Premature abstraction is often worse than code duplication because the wrong abstraction is harder to fix than duplicated code. When you abstract too early, you're making architectural decisions based on incomplete information. The resulting abstractions often become impediments that require significant effort to remove or work around.

Grug's wisdom teaches that "complexity very, very bad" - and premature abstraction is one of the most insidious sources of complexity. It creates the illusion of sophistication while actually making code harder to understand, test, and modify. The abstraction looks clever until the third use case arrives with requirements that don't fit the abstraction's assumptions.

Think of premature abstraction like building a bridge before you know where the river will flow. You might guess correctly, but more likely you'll build in the wrong place and have to tear it down when the river's actual path becomes clear. Code, like rivers, reveals its natural patterns over time through use and evolution.

## Rule Definition

**MUST** apply the "Rule of Three" before creating abstractions: require at least three concrete implementations showing the same pattern before extracting shared abstractions.

**MUST** resist abstraction when you have only:
- Two similar implementations with different contexts
- Speculation about future requirements
- Code that "looks like it might be reusable someday"
- Pressure to appear sophisticated or demonstrate advanced patterns

**SHOULD** prefer duplication over wrong abstractions in these situations:
- Requirements are still evolving rapidly
- The abstraction would couple previously independent components
- The pattern hasn't stabilized across different use cases
- The abstraction saves fewer than 10 lines of meaningful logic

**SHOULD** question any abstraction that requires:
- Complex configuration to handle variations
- Extensive documentation to explain how to use it
- Multiple parameters that are always passed together
- Frequent modification for new use cases

## Implementation Strategy

### Decision Framework for Abstraction

**Before Creating Any Abstraction, Validate:**

1. **Pattern Stability Test:**
   - Has the same logical pattern appeared 3+ times in independent contexts?
   - Have the interfaces remained stable through multiple feature additions?
   - Do variations follow predictable, parameterizable differences?

2. **Complexity Reduction Test:**
   - Does the abstraction eliminate more complexity than it creates?
   - Is the abstraction simpler to use than duplicating the code?
   - Would new team members understand the abstraction without extensive documentation?

3. **Future Flexibility Test:**
   - Will this abstraction make adding new variations easier or harder?
   - Can you accommodate likely future changes without breaking the abstraction?
   - Does the abstraction avoid assumptions about how it will be used?

### Warning Signs of Premature Abstraction

**❌ Speculation-Based Abstractions:**
```typescript
// BAD: Building for imagined future needs
interface FlexibleDataProcessor<T, U, V> {
  process<K>(
    data: T,
    options: ProcessingOptions<U>,
    transform: TransformFunction<T, V>,
    middleware: Middleware<K>[],
    context: ProcessingContext
  ): Promise<ProcessedResult<V>>;
}

// This looks sophisticated but probably won't fit actual use cases
// Start with concrete implementations instead
```

**❌ Two-Instance Abstractions:**
```typescript
// BAD: Abstracting after seeing only two cases
function sendNotification(type: 'email' | 'sms', message: string, recipient: string) {
  if (type === 'email') {
    return emailService.send(recipient, message);
  } else if (type === 'sms') {
    return smsService.send(recipient, message);
  }
}

// Wait for the third notification type to see the real pattern
// Maybe push notifications work completely differently
```

**❌ Configuration-Heavy Abstractions:**
```typescript
// BAD: Abstraction that requires complex configuration
class GenericValidator {
  constructor(
    private rules: ValidationRule[],
    private errorHandler: ErrorHandler,
    private transformers: DataTransformer[],
    private contextProviders: ContextProvider[],
    private middleware: ValidationMiddleware[]
  ) {}

  // More configuration than the actual validation logic
}
```

### Healthy Alternatives to Premature Abstraction

**✅ Start with Concrete Implementations:**
```typescript
// GOOD: Three concrete implementations that reveal the actual pattern
class UserEmailSender {
  async sendWelcomeEmail(user: User): Promise<void> {
    const template = await this.getTemplate('welcome');
    const personalizedContent = this.personalize(template, user);
    await this.emailService.send(user.email, personalizedContent);
    await this.trackDelivery('welcome_email', user.id);
  }
}

class OrderEmailSender {
  async sendOrderConfirmation(order: Order): Promise<void> {
    const template = await this.getTemplate('order_confirmation');
    const personalizedContent = this.personalize(template, order);
    await this.emailService.send(order.customerEmail, personalizedContent);
    await this.trackDelivery('order_confirmation', order.id);
  }
}

class NotificationEmailSender {
  async sendSystemAlert(alert: SystemAlert): Promise<void> {
    const template = await this.getTemplate('system_alert');
    const personalizedContent = this.personalize(template, alert);
    await this.emailService.send(alert.recipientEmail, personalizedContent);
    await this.trackDelivery('system_alert', alert.id);
  }
}

// NOW the pattern is clear: getTemplate → personalize → send → track
// Extract EmailSender<T> interface with confidence
```

**✅ Use Simple Utility Functions:**
```typescript
// GOOD: Simple, focused utilities instead of complex abstractions
function validateEmail(email: string): boolean {
  return /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(email);
}

function validatePhoneNumber(phone: string): boolean {
  return /^\+?[\d\s\-\(\)]+$/.test(phone);
}

function validateRequired(value: unknown): boolean {
  return value != null && value !== '';
}

// Clear, testable, and easy to understand
// Don't force these into a ValidationStrategy<T> pattern yet
```

### Common Premature Abstraction Patterns

**Generic Event Systems:**
```typescript
// ❌ PREMATURE: Built before understanding actual event needs
interface Event<T = any> {
  type: string;
  payload: T;
  metadata: EventMetadata;
  handlers: EventHandler<T>[];
}

// ✅ BETTER: Start with specific events
type UserRegistered = { userId: string; email: string; timestamp: Date };
type OrderPlaced = { orderId: string; customerId: string; total: number };
// Abstract only when you have 3+ event types with clear patterns
```

**Flexible Configuration Systems:**
```typescript
// ❌ PREMATURE: Over-configurable before knowing what needs configuration
interface AppConfig {
  features: Record<string, FeatureConfig>;
  services: Record<string, ServiceConfig>;
  environment: EnvironmentConfig;
  experimental: Record<string, unknown>;
}

// ✅ BETTER: Start with concrete configuration needs
interface AppConfig {
  databaseUrl: string;
  apiKey: string;
  debugMode: boolean;
}
// Add configuration options only as actual needs emerge
```

**Repository Abstractions:**
```typescript
// ❌ PREMATURE: Generic repository before understanding data access patterns
interface Repository<T, K> {
  find(criteria: SearchCriteria): Promise<T[]>;
  findById(id: K): Promise<T | null>;
  save(entity: T): Promise<T>;
  delete(id: K): Promise<void>;
  query(sql: string, params: unknown[]): Promise<T[]>;
}

// ✅ BETTER: Start with specific data access needs
class UserRepository {
  async findByEmail(email: string): Promise<User | null> { /* ... */ }
  async createUser(userData: CreateUserData): Promise<User> { /* ... */ }
  async updateLastLogin(userId: string): Promise<void> { /* ... */ }
}
// Abstract only when multiple repositories share meaningful patterns
```

## Anti-Patterns and Recovery Strategies

### Identifying Premature Abstractions

**Code Smells:**
- Abstractions used in only 1-2 places
- Complex configuration required to handle simple cases
- Frequent changes to abstraction interface for new use cases
- Documentation that's longer than the implementation
- Team members avoiding the abstraction and duplicating code instead

**Recovery Strategies:**
1. **"Un-refactor" back to concrete implementations**
2. **Document the lessons learned for future decisions**
3. **Wait for genuine third use case before re-abstracting**
4. **Consider whether the abstraction solves a real problem**

### Healthy Progression Path

**Phase 1: Concrete Implementations**
- Write specific, clear implementations for each use case
- Focus on making each implementation simple and correct
- Note similarities but resist immediate abstraction

**Phase 2: Pattern Recognition**
- After 3+ implementations, identify stable patterns
- Look for invariant parts vs. variable parts
- Ensure the pattern holds across different contexts

**Phase 3: Careful Abstraction**
- Extract only the stable, well-understood patterns
- Parameterize the variations, don't over-generalize
- Maintain simplicity in the abstraction's interface

## Success Metrics

**Healthy Abstraction Indicators:**
- Abstractions remain stable through multiple feature additions
- New implementations fit naturally without forcing changes
- Team members use abstractions without hesitation
- Abstractions reduce overall codebase complexity

**Warning Signs:**
- Abstractions require frequent modification
- New use cases force awkward compromises
- Documentation grows faster than implementation
- Developers work around abstractions instead of using them

## Related Patterns

**YAGNI Principle:** Don't build abstractions you aren't going to need. Wait for clear evidence before abstracting.

**Natural Refactoring Points:** Wait for natural boundaries to emerge before creating abstractions. This binding provides the specific warning signs to watch for.

**Rule of Three:** Require three concrete examples before abstracting. This provides enough data to identify real patterns vs. coincidental similarities.
