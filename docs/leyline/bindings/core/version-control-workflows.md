# Binding: Establish Systematic Version Control Workflows

Implement automated version control workflows that enforce consistent branching strategies, code review processes, and release management practices. Create systematic approaches to collaboration that maintain code quality while enabling rapid, safe iteration and deployment.

## Rationale

This binding applies our automation tenet to version control collaboration, transforming ad-hoc manual processes into systematic, automated workflows. Manual version control processes relying on developer memory and inconsistent review practices break down as teams grow. Automated workflows enforce consistent practices regardless of team size, enabling predictable, high-quality collaboration that scales effectively.

## Rule Definition

**Core Requirements:**

- **Trunk-Based Development**: Short-lived feature branches (1-3 days) with frequent main branch integration
- **Automated Branch Protection**: Prevent direct commits, require status checks and reviews before merging
- **Conventional Commit Standards**: Structured commit messages enabling automated changelog and semantic versioning
- **Systematic Code Review**: Required reviewers, review templates, and quality gate integration
- **Automated Release Management**: Automated changelog generation and version determination
- **Merge Conflict Prevention**: Frequent integration and automated conflict detection

**Essential Components:**
- Branch protection with status checks
- Pull request templates and reviewer assignment
- Conventional commit validation
- Automated changelog and versioning
- Release automation with deployment integration

## Practical Implementation

**Comprehensive Version Control Workflow Setup:**

1. **Branch Protection Configuration**: Prevent direct commits, require reviews and status checks
2. **Conventional Commit Enforcement**: Structured commit messages for automation
3. **Pull Request Templates**: Standardized review processes and checklists
4. **Automated Reviewer Assignment**: CODEOWNERS-based review routing
5. **Release Automation**: Automated changelog and semantic versioning

**Comprehensive Workflow Configuration:**

```yaml
# .github/branch-protection.yml - Complete workflow setup
name: main
protection:
  enforce_admins: true
  required_status_checks:
    strict: true
    contexts:
      - "ci/build"
      - "ci/test"
      - "ci/security-scan"
      - "ci/code-quality"

  required_pull_request_reviews:
    required_approving_review_count: 2
    dismiss_stale_reviews: true
    require_code_owner_reviews: true
    dismissal_restrictions:
      teams: ["maintainers"]

  restrictions:

```

```yaml
# Conventional commit validation
commit_message_regex: '^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore)(\(.+\))?: .{1,50}'

# Automated release workflow
name: Release
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: google-github-actions/release-please-action@v3
        with:
          release-type: node
          package-name: my-package
```

## Examples

```bash
# ❌ BAD: Inconsistent manual processes
git commit -m "fix"  # Non-conventional commit
git push origin main  # Direct push to main

# ✅ GOOD: Systematic workflow
git checkout -b feature/user-auth
git commit -m "feat(auth): add OAuth integration"
git push origin feature/user-auth
# Create PR with template, automated review assignment
# Merge only after approvals and CI passes
```
