# Binding: GitHub Actions Deprecation Prevention Quality Gates

Implement automated validation checkpoints that prevent CI failures from deprecated GitHub Actions by detecting deprecated actions early and providing clear upgrade guidance. This creates systematic barriers that catch deprecation issues before they impact the development pipeline.

## Rationale

This binding implements our automated-quality-gates principle by creating specific systems that prevent CI failures from GitHub Actions deprecations. As GitHub continuously evolves and deprecates older action versions, manual tracking becomes error-prone and reactive. Automated quality gates provide proactive protection against workflow failures.

GitHub Actions deprecations often cause sudden CI failures that can block critical releases. These failures are preventable through systematic validation that catches deprecations early, provides clear upgrade guidance, and ensures teams stay current with supported action versions.

## Rule Definition

**MUST** implement GitHub Actions validation at multiple pipeline stages:
- Pre-commit hooks for immediate developer feedback
- Pull request validation to prevent deprecated actions from entering main branch
- Scheduled scanning to catch new deprecations
- Integration with existing CI validation pipelines

**MUST** validate against a comprehensive deprecation database that includes:
- Deprecated action names and versions
- Deprecation dates and reasons
- Recommended upgrade paths with specific guidance
- Severity levels (high/medium/low) for prioritization

**MUST** provide fast feedback with specific, actionable upgrade guidance including:
- Exact replacement action and version
- Configuration changes required for upgrade
- Breaking changes and migration considerations

**SHOULD** maintain an updateable deprecation database that can be refreshed from external sources.

**SHOULD** include emergency override mechanisms for critical fixes with audit trails.

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components

```text
GitHub Actions Quality Gate System
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Validation Tool (tools/validate_github_actions.rb)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Deprecation Database (tools/github-actions-deprecations.yml)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CI Integration (.github/workflows/validate-actions.yml)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Local Development Integration (tools/run_ci_checks.rb)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Pre-commit Hook Integration
```

### 1. Validation Tool Implementation

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# tools/validate_github_actions.rb

require 'yaml'
require 'json'

# Core validation features:
# - YAML workflow parsing with error handling
# - Comprehensive action extraction from all job steps
# - Deprecation checking against maintained database
# - Clear upgrade guidance with severity levels
# - Structured logging for CI integration
# - Performance optimization for large repositories

def validate_workflow_file(file_path, deprecation_database)
  # Parse workflow and extract all 'uses:' references
  # Check each action against deprecation database
  # Generate detailed upgrade guidance
  # Return validation results with clear error messages
end

# Usage examples:
# ruby tools/validate_github_actions.rb                    # Validate all workflows
# ruby tools/validate_github_actions.rb -f workflow.yml    # Validate specific file
# ruby tools/validate_github_actions.rb --verbose          # Detailed output
```

### 2. Deprecation Database Structure

```yaml
# tools/github-actions-deprecations.yml
action_name@version:
  deprecated_since: '2024-01-01'
  reason: 'Specific deprecation reason'
  upgrade_to: 'recommended-action@v4'
  upgrade_guide: 'Detailed upgrade instructions'
  severity: 'high|medium|low'

# Examples:
actions/checkout@v3:
  deprecated_since: '2023-12-01'
  reason: 'Superseded by v4 with Node.js 20 support'
  upgrade_to: 'actions/checkout@v4'
  upgrade_guide: 'Update to v4 for Node.js 20 compatibility and latest features'
  severity: 'low'
```

### 3. CI Workflow Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/validate-actions.yml
name: Validate GitHub Actions

on:
  push:
    paths: ['.github/workflows/**']
  pull_request:
    paths: ['.github/workflows/**']
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Weekly scans for new deprecations

jobs:
  validate-actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: '3.0'

      - name: Scan for Deprecated Actions
        run: |
          export LEYLINE_STRUCTURED_LOGGING=true
          ruby tools/validate_github_actions.rb --verbose

      - name: Generate Actions Inventory
        run: |
          # Create comprehensive inventory of all actions in use
          # Upload as artifact for tracking and analysis
```

### 4. Local Development Integration

```ruby
# Integration with tools/run_ci_checks.rb

# Step 7: GitHub Actions validation (both essential and full modes)
puts "üîç GitHub Actions validation..."

if File.exist?("tools/validate_github_actions.rb")
  command = "ruby tools/validate_github_actions.rb#{$verbose ? ' --verbose' : ''}"
  unless run_command(command, "GitHub Actions deprecation check")
    failed_validations << "GitHub Actions validation"
  end
end
```

## Quality Gate Flow

### 1. Pre-commit Validation (Immediate Feedback)
```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/bash
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "\.github/workflows/"; then
  echo "üîç Validating GitHub Actions in changed workflows..."
  ruby tools/validate_github_actions.rb --verbose
fi
```

### 2. Pull Request Validation (Team Review)
- Automated workflow triggers on workflow file changes
- Comprehensive validation with detailed reporting
- Actions inventory generation for tracking
- Clear failure messages with upgrade guidance

### 3. Scheduled Monitoring (Proactive Detection)
- Weekly scans to catch new deprecations
- Automated issue creation for deprecated actions found
- Trending analysis of action usage across repositories

### 4. Emergency Override (Critical Fixes)
```yaml
# Emergency deployment with audit trail
- name: Check Emergency Override
  if: contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[emergency-deploy]')
  run: |
    echo "üö® Emergency override: Skipping deprecation validation"
    # Log to audit system for post-deployment review
```

## Severity Levels and Response

### High Severity (Immediate Action Required)
- **Impact**: Will cause CI failures imminently
- **Examples**: Node.js 12 actions, security vulnerabilities
- **Response**: Block PRs, require immediate upgrade
- **Timeline**: Fix within 1 week

### Medium Severity (Plan for Upgrade)
- **Impact**: Missing important features or patches
- **Examples**: Missing performance improvements
- **Response**: Warning in PRs, schedule upgrade
- **Timeline**: Fix within 1 month

### Low Severity (Future Planning)
- **Impact**: Superseded but still functional
- **Examples**: v3 ‚Üí v4 updates with same functionality
- **Response**: Informational notice, track for next maintenance cycle
- **Timeline**: Fix within 3 months

## Error Message Examples

### High Severity Deprecation
```
üö® DEPRECATED ACTION (HIGH severity)
  File: .github/workflows/ci.yml
  Job: test
  Step: Checkout code (#1)
  Action: actions/checkout@v1
  Reason: Uses deprecated Node.js 12 and lacks security features
  Deprecated since: 2021-01-01

üîß UPGRADE GUIDANCE:
  Replace with: actions/checkout@v4
  Guide: Update to v4 for Git LFS support and security improvements

üìù Example fix:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v1
  + uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

### Medium Severity Deprecation
```
‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED ACTION (MEDIUM severity)
  File: .github/workflows/deploy.yml
  Job: deploy
  Step: Setup Node.js (#2)
  Action: actions/setup-node@v2
  Reason: Missing security updates and performance improvements
  Deprecated since: 2023-06-01

üîß UPGRADE GUIDANCE:
  Replace with: actions/setup-node@v4
  Guide: Update to v4 for latest features and security patches
```

## Maintenance Strategy

### Database Updates
```bash
# Manual database updates
ruby tools/validate_github_actions.rb --update

# Scheduled updates (future implementation)
# - GitHub API integration for automated deprecation detection
# - Community-sourced deprecation database
# - Automated PR creation for database updates
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Validation execution time tracking
- Cache hit ratio optimization
- Workflow file parsing performance
- Database lookup efficiency

### False Positive Management
- Whitelist mechanism for internal/custom actions
- Configuration override for known false positives
- Community feedback integration for database accuracy

## Integration Examples

### TypeScript/Node.js Project
```yaml
# Typical deprecations caught:
- actions/setup-node@v1 ‚Üí actions/setup-node@v4
- actions/cache@v2 ‚Üí actions/cache@v4
- actions/upload-artifact@v2 ‚Üí actions/upload-artifact@v4
```

```

### Multi-language Project
```yaml
