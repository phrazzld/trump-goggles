# Binding: Practice Incremental Delivery and Continuous Deployment

Deliver software in small, frequent increments that can be safely deployed and easily reversed. This enables rapid feedback, reduces deployment risk, and maintains the ability to quickly adapt to changing requirements or rollback problematic changes.

## Rationale

This binding implements our adaptability and reversibility tenet by creating a delivery process that prioritizes safety, speed, and adaptability over large, risky releases. Small, frequent deployments reduce the blast radius of any single change, making it easier to identify and fix problems quickly. When changes are small and incremental, they're easier to understand, test, and reverse if necessary.

Think of incremental delivery like taking a cross-country road trip with frequent stops versus driving non-stop for 20 hours. With frequent stops, you can check your progress, adjust your route if needed, refuel, and address any problems while they're small. If you take a wrong turn, you've only lost a short distance and can quickly get back on track. Non-stop driving means problems compound, course corrections become expensive, and a single mistake can derail the entire journey.

Large, infrequent releases create deployment fear that leads to even longer release cycles as teams batch more changes together to "make the deployment worth it." This creates a vicious cycle where deployments become increasingly risky and stressful. Incremental delivery breaks this cycle by making deployments routine, low-risk events that enable rapid iteration and learning.

## Rule Definition

Incremental delivery must establish these deployment principles:

- **Small Batch Sizes**: Keep individual changes small and focused on single features or bug fixes. Large changes should be broken down into multiple smaller, independent deployments.

- **Automated Deployment Pipelines**: Use fully automated deployment processes that eliminate manual steps and reduce the chance of human error during releases.

- **Progressive Rollout Strategies**: Deploy changes gradually to subsets of users or infrastructure, allowing for monitoring and validation before full rollout.

- **Immediate Rollback Capability**: Maintain the ability to quickly and safely rollback any deployment if problems are detected. Rollback should be faster than rolling forward with a fix.

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting that can quickly detect problems after deployment and trigger automated responses.

- **Feature Branch Integration**: Use short-lived feature branches that are integrated frequently to avoid merge conflicts and integration problems.

**Deployment Strategies:**
- Blue-green deployments for zero-downtime releases
- Canary releases for gradual validation
- Rolling updates for distributed systems
- Feature flags for decoupling deployment from release
- Database migration automation for schema changes

**Quality Gates:**
- Automated testing at multiple levels (unit, integration, e2e)
- Performance benchmarking and regression detection
- Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- Compliance validation for regulated environments

## Practical Implementation

1. **Implement Deployment Automation**: Create fully automated deployment pipelines that handle building, testing, deploying, and verifying releases without manual intervention.

2. **Use Database Migration Strategies**: Implement backward-compatible database changes that can be deployed incrementally without breaking existing functionality.

3. **Create Rollback Procedures**: Establish automated rollback mechanisms that can quickly restore previous versions when problems are detected.

4. **Monitor Key Metrics**: Track deployment frequency, lead time, failure rate, and recovery time to continuously improve your delivery process.

5. **Practice Trunk-Based Development**: Use trunk-based development with short-lived feature branches to minimize integration complexity and enable frequent releases.

# Problems:
# 1. Large batches mean high risk of failure
# 2. Infrequent deployments make each one stressful
# 3. No automated rollback capability
# 4. Manual verification creates bottlenecks
# 5. All-or-nothing deployment increases blast radius
