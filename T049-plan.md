# T049 Plan: Fix All Remaining TypeScript Errors

## Overview

This task involves resolving all remaining TypeScript errors in the codebase to ensure full type safety and allow commits without the need for `--no-verify`. The errors are present in several key files including browser-detect.js, error-handler.js, logger.js, and there are also issues with import paths and implicit any types in test files.

## Analysis

The task requires addressing several categories of TypeScript errors:

1. Interface compatibility issues in core utility files
2. Import path issues with .ts extensions
3. Implicit any types in test files
4. Remaining type errors in performance-test-runner.js

This is a complex task because it affects multiple modules, requires careful consideration of interfaces and types, and may impact the behavior of critical infrastructure code like error handling and logging.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Browser-detect.js Interface Compatibility

1. Examine TypeScript errors in browser-detect.js
2. Identify interface compatibility issues
3. Create or update appropriate interfaces in types.d.ts
4. Fix the implementation to comply with TypeScript's type system
5. Ensure backwards compatibility with existing code

### 2. Error-handler.js Interface Compatibility

1. Examine TypeScript errors in error-handler.js
2. Define proper error interfaces/types
3. Implement proper error handling with appropriate types
4. Ensure error types are properly exported and used consistently

### 3. Logger.js Interface Compatibility

1. Review the current logger implementation
2. Define appropriate interfaces for logger methods and levels
3. Fix type issues in the logger implementation
4. Ensure the logger conforms to the structured logging requirements in the Development Philosophy

### 4. Import Path Issues with .ts Extensions

1. Identify imports with incorrect paths (missing .ts extensions or using incorrect extensions)
2. Standardize import paths based on module resolution strategy in tsconfig.json
3. Update imports to ensure TypeScript can properly resolve dependencies
4. Test changes to ensure modules are correctly resolved

### 5. Implicit Any Types in Test Files

1. Identify test files with implicit any types
2. Add proper type annotations using JSDoc in JavaScript files or explicit types in TypeScript files
3. Create mock interfaces where needed for test objects
4. Ensure all function parameters and return values have explicit types

### 6. Remaining Type Errors in performance-test-runner.js

1. Address any remaining type issues in performance-test-runner.js that weren't fixed in T048
2. Add proper null checks and type assertions
3. Create additional interfaces or types as needed
4. Ensure compatibility with the browser's performance API

## Testing Strategy

1. Run TypeScript compiler (tsc) to verify type checking passes
2. Run tests to ensure functionality remains intact
3. Verify pre-commit hooks pass without --no-verify
4. Review any performance implications of the changes

## Done-when Criteria

1. All TypeScript errors are resolved
2. Pre-commit hooks pass without --no-verify
3. No new errors are introduced
4. Test suite continues to pass
5. Code adheres to TypeScript best practices defined in Development Philosophy
