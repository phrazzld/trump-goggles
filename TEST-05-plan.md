# TEST-05: Create Test File and Structure for Nickname Mappings

## Task Summary
The task requires creating a test file and structure for nickname mappings. Upon investigation, we discovered that the file `test/content/trump-mappings.test.js` already exists and is well-structured with 10 passing tests.

## Investigation Findings
1. The test file `test/content/trump-mappings.test.js` has already been created
2. It contains comprehensive tests for the Trump mappings functionality
3. The file includes tests for:
   - Trump Map Structure
   - Trump Map Usage
   - Mapping Tests with Fixtures
   - Helper Methods
4. The test file is properly integrated with the test runner, and all tests are passing

## Approach for Completion
Since the test file already exists and meets all the requirements specified in the task:
1. Confirm the existing file meets all the acceptance criteria
2. Document that the task has already been implemented
3. Mark the task as completed

## Verification
1. Confirmed the test file exists at the correct path
2. Reviewed the test structure and confirmed it follows project conventions
3. Ran `pnpm test` and verified all 10 tests in the file are passing

## Acceptance Criteria Review
- ✅ Test file exists at `test/content/trump-mappings.test.js`
- ✅ The test file follows project test structure conventions
- ✅ The test file includes appropriate imports
- ✅ The test file contains a well-organized describe block structure
- ✅ All tests in the file are passing
