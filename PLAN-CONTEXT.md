# Task Description

## Issue Details

**Issue #9**: "Implement Structured JSON Logging for All Operations"
**URL**: https://github.com/phrazzld/trump-goggles/issues/9

## Overview

Replace direct console.\* usage with a structured JSON logging system to enable better log analysis, filtering, and monitoring. This addresses a critical requirement from DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md that forbids console.log for operational logging and mandates structured logging.

## Requirements

- Dedicated logging utility implemented
- All operational logs emitted in JSON format
- Mandatory context fields (timestamp, level, message, component, etc.)
- Direct console.\* use removed for operational logging
- Must align with DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md logging requirements

## Technical Context

**Current State:**

- `src/utils/logger.js` exists but may use console.\* directly
- Background/content scripts likely use direct console logging
- All components using logging need migration
- Unstructured logs prevent aggregation/analysis

**Labels:**

- Priority: High
- Type: Feature
- Size: Medium (multiple files, moderate complexity)
- Domain: Build system and packaging

## Related Issues

- **Dependency for Issue #6**: "BLOCKER: Mitigate Potential XSS via Unescaped Data in Logs" (critical priority)
- **Supports Issue #23**: "Standardize Error Handling with Structured Logger" (high priority)

## Dependencies

None (can be implemented as standalone utility)

## Files Affected

- `src/utils/logger.js`
- Background/content scripts
- All components using logging
