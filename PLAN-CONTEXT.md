## Selected Issue for Implementation Plan

**Issue**: [#14 - Ensure Core Mappings are Immutable](https://github.com/phrazzld/trump-goggles/issues/14)

### Issue Details
- **Type**: Bug Fix
- **Priority**: High
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Labels**: priority:high, type:bug, size:m, domain:content
- **State**: OPEN

### Problem Statement
trumpMap object in src/data/trump-mappings.js is mutable, which could lead to runtime bugs. Violates DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md Default to Immutability.

### Expected Outcome
trumpMap and other core mapping data structures are made immutable using:
- Deep-freezing (Object.freeze())
- TypeScript Readonly types

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] trumpMap object is immutable
- [ ] All core mapping data structures protected
- [ ] TypeScript Readonly types implemented
- [ ] Tests verify immutability

### Files Affected
- src/data/trump-mappings.js
- Related mapping files

### Dependencies
- TypeScript conversion (#7)

### Strategic Context
This issue was selected for implementation planning because:

1. **High Priority**: Marked as priority:high, indicating it's important for current iteration
2. **Concrete Scope**: Well-defined technical problem with clear acceptance criteria
3. **Medium Complexity**: Substantial enough to benefit from detailed planning but not overwhelming
4. **Architecture Aligned**: Supports fundamental development philosophy principles
5. **Independent**: Can be implemented without waiting for other major architectural changes
6. **Foundation Building**: Establishes immutability patterns that will benefit future development

### Technical Significance
- Prevents runtime bugs from accidental mutation
- Aligns with DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md principles
- Establishes immutability patterns for the codebase
- Provides foundation for safer data structure handling
- Enables better compiler optimizations and IDE support
