# TEST-02: Conduct Manual Cross-Browser Testing

## Task Description
Thoroughly test the Trump Goggles extension in multiple browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility and proper functionality.

## Test Approach

### 1. Environment Setup
- Prepare Chrome and Firefox browsers for testing
- Create a testing checklist to track results
- Prepare test webpages with static and dynamic content

### 2. Chrome Testing
- Install the extension in Chrome
- Verify installation process works without errors
- Check browser console for any errors during installation
- Test basic functionality:
  - Icon click opens options page
  - Text replacement works on static content
  - Text replacement works on dynamic content (AJAX loaded)
  - Form input fields are not affected by replacements
- Test edge cases:
  - Large pages with many text nodes
  - Pages with iframes
  - Pages with complex DOM structures

### 3. Firefox Testing
- Perform the same test suite in Firefox
- Note any browser-specific differences
- Verify all functionality works consistently across browsers

### 4. Error Condition Testing
- Simulate network failures
- Test with invalid mappings data
- Verify appropriate error messages are displayed
- Check error recovery mechanisms

### 5. Performance Testing
- Test on pages with large amounts of content
- Monitor memory usage during extended browsing sessions
- Check for performance degradation over time

### 6. Documentation
- Document any browser-specific issues discovered
- Create a comprehensive test report
- Update user documentation if needed

## Implementation Plan
1. Create test pages with various content types
2. Develop a systematic testing methodology
3. Execute tests in Chrome
4. Execute tests in Firefox 
5. Document results
6. Update TODO.md to reflect completed testing
