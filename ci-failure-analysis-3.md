# CI Failure Analysis - Round 3

## Issue Overview
After updating the Node.js version ranges, the CI workflow is still failing with a more specific Node.js version error:

```
Your Node version is incompatible with "registry.npmjs.org/eslint/9.26.0".
Expected version: ^18.18.0 || ^20.9.0 || >=21.1.0
Got: 18.0.0
```

## Root Cause Analysis
ESLint 9.26.0 has specific Node.js version requirements that are more granular than just major versions. It requires:
- Node.js 18.18.0 or higher in the 18.x series
- Node.js 20.9.0 or higher in the 20.x series
- Node.js 21.1.0 or higher for version 21+

Our current configuration is too broad and allows incompatible Node.js versions.

## Fix Recommendations

1. Update the CI workflow to use specific compatible Node.js versions:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node-version: ['18.18.0', '20.9.0']
```

2. Update the package.json file to specify the correct Node.js version requirement:

```json
"engines": {
  "node": "^18.18.0 || ^20.9.0 || >=21.1.0",
  "pnpm": ">=7.0.0"
},
```

3. Update the .npmrc file to use a compatible Node.js version:

```
use-node-version=18.18.0
```

## Implementation Plan
1. Update the ci.yml file with the specific Node.js versions
2. Update package.json to require the specific Node.js versions
3. Update .npmrc to specify Node.js 18.18.0
4. Commit and push the changes
5. Re-run the GitHub Actions workflow
6. Verify that the CI passes successfully

These changes ensure that we're using very specific Node.js versions that are compatible with our dependencies.
