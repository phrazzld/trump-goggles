Complete TypeScript migration of remaining JavaScript files

## Original Ticket Text

- [ ] T056: Complete TypeScript migration of remaining JavaScript files
  - Convert test/fixtures/\*.js files to TypeScript or add proper type declarations
  - Convert test/e2e/\*.js files to TypeScript
  - Restore full test directory TypeScript checking (currently main src only)
  - Remove temporary exclusions from tsconfig.json
  - Ensure full codebase TypeScript compliance

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

Analyze this task and provide a comprehensive implementation approach considering:

1. **Current State Analysis**: What JavaScript files remain? What are their purposes and dependencies?

2. **Migration Strategy**: Should fixtures be converted to TypeScript or just have type declarations? What's the best approach for e2e tests?

3. **Type Design**: How should fixture data be typed? What interfaces or types are needed?

4. **Configuration Updates**: What changes are needed to tsconfig.json? How to ensure proper TypeScript checking coverage?

5. **Testing Strategy**: How to validate the migration doesn't break anything? What tests need to be run?

6. **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong during this migration? How to mitigate risks?

7. **Implementation Order**: What's the optimal sequence of changes to minimize disruption?

8. **Success Criteria**: How do we know the migration is complete and successful?

Please provide a detailed, actionable plan that follows our development philosophy of simplicity, testability, and maintainability.
