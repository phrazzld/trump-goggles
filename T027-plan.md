# T027 - Restore cross-browser-compatibility-report.md File

## Task Description
Restore the deleted `cross-browser-compatibility-report.md` file which documents compatibility testing of the Trump Goggles extension across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, and Edge) and update it with TooltipBrowserAdapter considerations if relevant.

## Implementation Approach

1. Research the git history to find the original content of cross-browser-compatibility-report.md
   - Used `git log --all --full-history -- "cross-browser-compatibility-report.md"` to find relevant commits
   - Found that the file was originally created in commit b82f88dde910c3abfbf40ca82821ce9e4709d133
   - It was then formatted with Prettier in commit 6a3b9e3a3b5b4f48d1f606d80f5a7ba3a638fbe5
   - Image references were updated in commit de5c66cceed2616e66e298fc5b3c1282232866b8
   - Finally, it was deleted in commit e51d1a6c3acb21a1544dea3453718fe68162e25e

2. Review the TooltipBrowserAdapter implementation to identify any relevant cross-browser considerations
   - Analyzed `tooltip-browser-adapter.ts` to understand its cross-browser compatibility features
   - Found that it handles browser-specific differences in:
     - Feature detection for high z-index support, pointer-events, CSS transitions, and visibility API
     - Browser-specific style adjustments for Firefox, Safari, and Edge
     - CSS conversion for different browser engines
     - Event handling differences between browsers

3. Review other cross-browser related files
   - Examined `browser-detect.js` which provides browser detection capabilities
   - Reviewed `build-browser-extensions.sh` to understand the current build process for different browsers
   - Checked `browser-testing-instructions.md` for testing procedures

4. Restore cross-browser-compatibility-report.md
   - Use the most recent version before deletion as the base
   - Update with information about the TooltipBrowserAdapter if needed
   - Ensure the content remains accurate and up-to-date

5. Update TODO.md to mark T027 as completed
