# T028 - Add Newline to End of PLAN.md

## Task Description
Add a newline character to the end of PLAN.md file to ensure proper formatting and compatibility with text processing tools.

## Implementation Approach

1. Understand the context of the task
   - The task refers to adding a newline to PLAN.md (CR-17 in REMEDIATION_PLAN.md)
   - However, there is no file named PLAN.md in the repository
   - The likely intention is to ensure that REMEDIATION_PLAN.md (which contains the list of tasks, including this one) has a newline at the end

2. Check if REMEDIATION_PLAN.md has a newline at the end
   - Used hexdump to check the last bytes of the file
   - Confirmed that REMEDIATION_PLAN.md already ends with a newline character (0x0A)

3. Consider possible interpretations
   - The task might be obsolete if REMEDIATION_PLAN.md already has a newline
   - There might have been a PLAN.md file that was renamed to REMEDIATION_PLAN.md
   - The task could be referring to a different file

4. Determine appropriate action
   - Since REMEDIATION_PLAN.md (which appears to be the intended target) already has a newline at the end
   - And there is no file named PLAN.md in the repository
   - The most appropriate action is to mark the task as completed, noting that the requirement is already satisfied

5. Update TODO.md to mark T028 as completed
