# CI-03: Fix Browser Detection Type Errors

## Task Description
Address reference errors in browser detection code, particularly the 'InstallTrigger' reference error in `browser-detect.js:66`, implement proper type guards for browser-specific features, and consider refactoring to use feature detection instead of browser detection.

## Analysis
This task requires fixing type errors in the browser detection utility. The main issues appear to be:

1. The `InstallTrigger` reference is causing a TypeScript error because this is a Firefox-specific global object that isn't properly defined in the TypeScript types.
2. The code likely lacks proper type guards when accessing browser-specific features.
3. The current approach may be using browser detection instead of feature detection, which is generally considered less reliable.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Fix InstallTrigger Reference Error
- The `InstallTrigger` is a Firefox-specific global object that was used to detect Firefox.
- This object is now deprecated and less reliable for detection.
- Replace it with a more modern approach such as using the user-agent string or feature detection.

### 2. Implement Proper Type Guards
- Add type guards before accessing browser-specific properties and methods.
- Use TypeScript's type narrowing capabilities (typeof checks, property existence checks).
- Ensure all browser-specific code paths are properly guarded with correct type guards.

### 3. Refactor to Use Feature Detection
- Where applicable, replace browser detection with feature detection.
- Instead of checking for specific browsers, check if the required feature/API is available.
- This approach is more future-proof and less likely to break with browser updates.

### 4. Testing and Verification
- Run TypeScript type checking to verify the fixes.
- Ensure all tests pass after the changes.
- Manually verify browser detection works correctly in different browsers (if possible).

## Risk Assessment
- Low to Medium risk
- The changes are isolated to a single file, but browser detection is a critical part of cross-browser compatibility.
- Thorough testing is needed to ensure the detection logic continues to work correctly in all supported browsers.
