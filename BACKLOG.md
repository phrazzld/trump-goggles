# BACKLOG

## Future Improvements

These tasks are out of scope for the current implementation but should be considered for future work:

- [ ] **FUT-01**: Introduce automated testing (unit tests for `buildTrumpMap`, integration tests for content script functionality)
- [ ] **FUT-02**: Convert JavaScript files to TypeScript for better type safety and tooling
- [ ] **FUT-03**: Implement a module bundler (Webpack/Rollup) to replace global function sharing
- [ ] **FUT-04**: Refine and expand type definitions in `types.d.ts`
- [ ] **FUT-05**: Adopt `webextension-polyfill` library for cross-browser compatibility
