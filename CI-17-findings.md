# GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration Analysis

## Workflow Files
- Main CI workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Secondary workflow: `.github/workflows/vendor-docs.yml`

## Artifact Upload Usage

### CI Workflow
- **Line 54-58**: Uses `actions/upload-artifact@v4` to upload coverage reports
  ```yaml
  - name: Upload Coverage Report
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
    with:
      name: coverage-report
      path: coverage/
      retention-days: 14
  ```

- **Issues Identified**:
  1. The artifact name `coverage-report` is static and doesn't include any unique identifiers
  2. This could cause conflicts when multiple jobs/runs try to upload an artifact with the same name
  3. The CI workflow has a matrix setup for Node.js versions (18.18.0 and 20.9.0), which means two jobs running in parallel
  4. Both jobs try to upload an artifact with the same name, leading to conflicts

### Vendor-Docs Workflow
- No direct artifact uploads in this workflow
- This workflow uses an external action: `phrazzld/leyline/.github/workflows/vendor.yml@v0.1.0`

## Current Artifact Naming Convention
- Static name: `coverage-report`
- No dynamic values or unique identifiers
- No job/matrix value incorporated in the name

## Recommendations for CI-18
1. Update the artifact name to include the Node.js version from the matrix:
   ```yaml
   name: coverage-report-node-${{ matrix.node-version }}
   ```

2. Alternatively, include the GitHub run ID for uniqueness:
   ```yaml
   name: coverage-report-${{ github.run_id }}-${{ matrix.node-version }}
   ```

3. Consider adding conditions to only upload artifacts from one specific Node.js version:
   ```yaml
   if: matrix.node-version == '20.9.0'
   ```

4. The `actions/upload-artifact` is already using v4, which is the latest version, so no upgrade needed

5. Keep the retention-days parameter as it helps manage storage usage

## Next Steps
Implement these recommendations in task CI-18 to resolve the artifact naming conflicts.
