# T018 Plan: Remove ineffective element caching from TooltipManager

## Problem Analysis
The TooltipManager module mentions "Element caching to avoid repeated DOM queries" in its header comments (tooltip-manager.ts:10), but there is no actual implementation of an element cache in the code. The task is to remove this reference to make the documentation accurate.

## Current State
- The header comment in tooltip-manager.ts mentions element caching as a performance optimization
- There is no actual elementCache implementation in the code
- This is misleading as it implies functionality that doesn't exist

## Solution Approach
1. Remove the reference to element caching from the header comment
2. Ensure tests still pass as this is only a documentation change

## Implementation Steps
1. Update the header comment in tooltip-manager.ts to remove the reference to element caching
2. Run tests to verify no functional impact
3. Update TODO.md to mark task as completed
4. Commit changes with appropriate message
