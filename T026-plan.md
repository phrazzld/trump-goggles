# T026 - Restore AUTHORS.md File

## Task Description
Restore the deleted `AUTHORS.md` file which lists authors, contributors, and acknowledgments for the Trump Goggles project.

## Implementation Approach

1. Research the git history to find the original content of the AUTHORS.md file
   - Use `git log --all --full-history -- AUTHORS.md` to find relevant commits
   - Use `git log -p --all --full-history -- AUTHORS.md` to view the actual file content in different commits

2. Identify any modifications made to the file before it was deleted
   - Found that the file was originally created in commit 8830cc7a84d136cb720adb023cbbb6713d839a98
   - It was then formatted with Prettier in commit 6a3b9e3a3b5b4f48d1f606d80f5a7ba3a638fbe5
   - Finally, it was deleted in commit e51d1a6c3acb21a1544dea3453718fe68162e25e

3. Check current contributors to ensure the file is up to date
   - Used `git log --format='%aN <%aE>' | sort -u` to list all authors
   - Found contributors: Phaedrus <phraznikov@gmail.com>, phaedrus <phrazzld@pm.me>, phrazzld <phrazzld@pm.me>
   - These appear to be the same person using different email addresses

4. Restore the AUTHORS.md file with its previous content, updating the maintainer information
   - Created a new AUTHORS.md file based on the last known version
   - Updated the maintainer information to include the GitHub username found in the commit history
   - Kept the rest of the content the same as the original file

5. Update TODO.md to mark T026 as completed
