# CI-04: Clean Up Test Files

## Task Description
Address unused variable warnings in test files, specifically in `test/content/text-processor.test.js` and `test/content/mutation-observer.test.js`.

## Analysis
ESLint is reporting warnings about unused variables in test files:
1. Unused variables `result` and `text` in `text-processor.test.js`
2. Unused variable `observer` in multiple locations in `mutation-observer.test.js`
3. Unused variables `mockDomProcessor`, `mockObserver`, and `createTestDOM` in `mutation-observer.test.js`

These warnings should be addressed according to JavaScript best practices. Since these are test files, the most appropriate approach is to prefix unused variables with an underscore to indicate they are intentionally unused, which is a common convention in test code.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Fix unused variables in text-processor.test.js
- Examine the file to locate the unused variables `result` and `text`
- Prefix these variables with underscores (e.g., `_result`, `_text`) to indicate they are intentionally unused
- Ensure any code that depends on these variables continues to work correctly

### 2. Fix unused variables in mutation-observer.test.js
- Locate all instances of the unused variable `observer`
- Locate the unused variables `mockDomProcessor`, `mockObserver`, and `createTestDOM`
- Prefix all unused variables with underscores
- Ensure any code that depends on these variables continues to work correctly

### 3. Verify changes
- Run ESLint on the modified files to ensure all unused variable warnings are resolved
- Run the test suite to ensure all tests still pass
- Check that no new warnings or errors are introduced

## Risk Assessment
- Low risk: These changes are limited to test files and involve only renaming variables
- The changes do not affect the functionality of the tests or the application code
- The main risk is that some of these variables might be used in ways that aren't immediately apparent, so thorough testing is important
