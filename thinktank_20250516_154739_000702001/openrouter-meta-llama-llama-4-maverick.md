## Chosen Approach

Configure Rollup with ES Module support for browser extension compatibility.

## Rationale

- Rollup is better suited for library/browser extension development due to its simpler configuration and superior tree-shaking capabilities.
- ES Module support is native to Rollup, making it a natural choice for modern JavaScript projects.
- Multiple entry points can be handled through Rollup's flexible configuration options.
- Development and production builds can be differentiated using environment-based configuration.

## Build Steps

1. Install Rollup and necessary plugins (`@rollup/plugin-node-resolve`, `@rollup/plugin-commonjs`, `rollup-plugin-terser`).
2. Create `rollup.config.js` with multiple entry points for content scripts and background scripts.
3. Configure Rollup to output IIFE format for browser compatibility.
4. Implement environment-based configuration for development (source maps, minimal optimization) and production (minification, optimization).
5. Update `manifest.json` to point to the correct built files.
6. Add build scripts to `package.json` for development and production builds.
