## Option 2: Rollup Configuration

| Section          | Verdict | Comment                                                |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Simplicity       | ✔      | rollup has a simpler configuration compared to webpack |
| Modularity       | ✔      | supports modular code organization                     |
| Testability      | ✔      | easy to integrate with testing frameworks              |
| Coding Standards | ✔      | aligns with existing project structure                 |
| Docs Approach    | ✔      | extensive documentation available                      |

- **Summary:** Configure rollup for ES Module browser extension build.
- **Steps:**
  - Select rollup as the bundler
  - Configure rollup for ES Module support
  - Set up output format for browser extension compatibility
  - Implement build scripts for development and production
  - Ensure manifest.json points to correct built files
- **Pros / Cons:**
  - Pros: simpler configuration, better tree-shaking, designed for libraries
  - Cons: smaller ecosystem compared to webpack, potential limitations in plugins
- **Risks:**
  - critical: potential limitations in plugins may impact functionality
  - high: smaller ecosystem may lead to fewer resources for troubleshooting
  - medium: may require additional configuration for specific functionality
  - low: learning curve for new team members

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach

| Section          | Verdict | Comment                                    |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Simplicity       | ✖      | combines webpack and rollup configurations |
| Modularity       | ✔      | supports modular code organization         |
| Testability      | ✔      | easy to integrate with testing frameworks  |
| Coding Standards | ✔      | aligns with existing project structure     |
