## Chosen Approach

Use Rollup to bundle ES Modules for the browser extension, prioritizing simplicity and efficient tree-shaking.

## Rationale

- **Simplicity:** Rollup's straightforward configuration (e.g., single config file with minimal plugins) outscores Webpack's verbose setup, reducing accidental complexity and aligning with the philosophy's "Simplicity First" principle by avoiding over-engineering.
- **Modularity and Strict Separation:** Rollup enables clean separation of entry points (e.g., content and background scripts) via dedicated configurations, promoting modularity without coupling concerns, unlike Webpack's ecosystem which often requires additional loaders that blur boundaries.
- **Testability:** Rollup's output supports minimal mocking for external dependencies, as its tree-shaking preserves modular imports, making it easier to test isolated modules compared to Webpack's potential for bloated bundles that complicate unit testing.
- **Coding Standards:** Rollup adheres to standards by generating pure ES Module outputs, minimizing polyfills and aligning with immutability and strict typing, whereas Webpack's flexibility risks introducing non-standard patterns if not carefully managed.
- **Documentation Approach:** Rollup's simpler setup allows for self-documenting scripts and configs, focusing documentation on rationale rather than mechanics, in line with the philosophy's emphasis on explaining "why" over "how."

## Build Steps

1. Install Rollup and necessary plugins: Run `npm install rollup @rollup/plugin-node-resolve @rollup/plugin-commonjs rollup-plugin-terser --save-dev` to handle ES Modules, CommonJS dependencies, and minification.
2. Create a Rollup configuration file: In `rollup.config.js`, define inputs for multiple entry points (e.g., `input: { 'content': 'src/content.ts', 'background': 'src/background.ts' }`), output as IIFE for browser compatibility, and enable tree-shaking with plugins for resolving modules and minifying production builds.
3. Configure development and production modes: Use Rollup's command-line options to differentiate builds (e.g., add source maps and disable minification for dev via `rollup --config --environment BUILD:development`), ensuring the config file uses environment variables for variations.
4. Integrate with project scripts: Add scripts to `package.json` (e.g., `"build:dev": "rollup --config --environment BUILD:development"`, `"build:prod": "rollup --config --environment BUILD:production"`), and document the process in a `BUILD.md` file focusing on rationale and usage.
5. Verify output compatibility: Run the build, check that the bundled files work in a browser extension environment (e.g., load in Chrome with manifest.json pointing to outputs), and ensure ES Module features like imports/exports are processed correctly.
6. Document and test the build: Update project documentation to include build commands, expected outputs, and troubleshooting, while adding tests to validate the bundle (e.g., unit tests for entry points using Jest).
