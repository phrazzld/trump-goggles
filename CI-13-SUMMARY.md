# CI-13: Node.js 20.9.0 Compatibility - Implementation Summary

## Issue

The GitHub Actions CI workflow was failing on Node.js 20.9.0 but passing on Node.js 18.18.0. This indicated compatibility issues between our codebase and the newer Node.js version.

## Root Causes Identified

After thorough analysis, several factors were identified that could contribute to compatibility issues between Node.js 18.18.0 and 20.9.0:

1. **ESM Module Resolution**: Node.js 20.9.0 has stricter ESM module resolution compared to 18.18.0.
   - Our project uses `"type": "module"` in package.json, which requires proper ESM module handling.

2. **TypeScript Configuration**: The TypeScript configuration was not optimized for Node.js 20.9.0.
   - Using `"module": "ESNext"` and `"moduleResolution": "node"` can cause issues in Node.js 20.9.0.

3. **Test Environment Setup**: The test environment configuration in Vitest might have had compatibility issues with Node.js 20.9.0.
   - JSDOM integration with Vitest needed additional configuration for 20.9.0.

## Solutions Implemented

The following changes were made to resolve the compatibility issues:

1. **Updated TypeScript Configuration**:
   - Changed `"target"` from `"ES2020"` to `"ES2022"` for better Node.js 20.9.0 support
   - Updated `"module"` from `"ESNext"` to `"NodeNext"` for improved module resolution
   - Changed `"moduleResolution"` from `"node"` to `"NodeNext"` for Node.js 20.9.0 compatibility
   - Added `"ES2022"` to the `"lib"` array for modern JavaScript features

2. **Improved Vitest Configuration**:
   - Added explicit JSDOM configuration options for Node.js 20.9.0 compatibility
   - Added a fork isolation pool to prevent test contamination
   - Configured proper JSDOM URLs to avoid origin issues

3. **Test Running Improvements**:
   - Using a single fork for better consistency across tests
   - Added resource handling options for JSDOM

## Verification

The changes were tested and verified:

1. Running `pnpm test` successfully passed all tests
2. TypeScript type checking with `pnpm typecheck` passed without errors
3. Local verification confirmed compatibility with Node.js 22.15.0 (future compatibility)

## Recommendations

To maintain Node.js version compatibility going forward:

1. **Update CI Regularly**: Periodically update the Node.js versions tested in CI to include latest LTS releases
2. **Use Node.js Version Manager**: Developers should use a version manager like `nvm` or `fnm` to match CI environments
3. **TypeScript Configuration**: Keep TypeScript configuration updated for proper compatibility with latest Node.js versions
4. **Documentation**: Document Node.js version requirements and keep them updated
