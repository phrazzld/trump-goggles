# MutationObserver Implementation Plan

## Task Description
Add support for dynamically loaded content using MutationObserver. This will ensure that content loaded after the initial page load (such as in single-page applications or infinite scrolling pages) will still have Trump's nicknames applied.

## Implementation Approach

1. Create a MutationObserver that watches for changes to the DOM
2. Target changes to the document body
3. Focus on added nodes and character data changes
4. Process new nodes through the existing walk function
5. Add error handling around DOM operations
6. Optimize to prevent unnecessary processing

## Code Changes

1. Add a module-level MutationObserver initialization
2. Configure it to observe body mutations
3. Process added nodes and character data changes
4. Add error handling around DOM operations
5. Add ability to disconnect observer if needed

## Benefits
- Extension will work with dynamically loaded content in modern web applications
- Improves user experience on sites with infinite scrolling or AJAX content loading
- Makes the extension more robust in the current web landscape

## Testing Strategy
- Manual testing on various types of websites with dynamic content:
  - Social media sites with infinite scrolling
  - News sites with dynamic loading
  - Single-page applications
- Ensure performance remains acceptable with continuous observation
